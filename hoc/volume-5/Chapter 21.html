<p><em>Definition of the Word "Mormon"--Discourse on Making "Calling" and "Election" Sure--Mission to the Society Islands Opened--Character Sketch of the Prophet, "Boston Bee"--Trial of Benjamin Winchester.</em></p>
<p><em>Saturday, May 20, 1843.--</em>Received of Ezra Oakley a certificate of deposit in the Fulton Bank, New York, value five hundred dollars, and gave receipt payable in lands or money ten days from date.</p>
<p>At court room, and adjourned the case of Samuel Fuller.</p>
<p>Corrected and sent to the <em>Times and Seasons </em>the following:</p>
<p>The Prophet's Definition of the Word "Mormon."</p>
<p><em>Editor of the Times and Seasons:</em></p>
<p>Sir--Through the medium of your paper I wish to correct an error among men that profess to be learned, liberal and wise; and I do it the more cheerfully because I hope sober-thinking and sound-reasoning people will sooner listen to the voice of truth than be led astray by the vain pretensions of the self-wise.</p>
<p>The error I speak of is the definition of the word "Mormon." It has been stated that this word was derived from the Greek word <em>mormo.</em> This is not the case. There was no Greek or Latin upon the plates from which I, through the grace of the Lord, translated the Book of Mormon. Let the language of the book speak for itself.</p>
<p><a name="399 - 400" id="399 - 400"></a>On the 523rd page of the fourth edition, it reads: "And now, behold we have written this record according to our knowledge in the characters which are called among us the Reformed Egyptian, being handed down and altered by us, according to our manner of speech; and if our plates had been sufficiently large, we should have written in Hebrew; but the Hebrew hath been altered by us also; and if we could have written in Hebrew, behold, ye would have had no imperfection in our record. But the Lord knoweth the things which we have written, and also that none other people knoweth our language; therefore He hath prepared means for the interpretation thereof."</p>
<p><a name="400" id="400"></a>[Page 400]</p>
<p>Here, then, the subject is put to silence; for "none other people knoweth our language;" therefore the Lord, and not man, had to interpret, after the people were all dead. And, as Paul said, "The world by wisdom know not God;" so the world by speculation are destitute of revelation; and as God in His superior wisdom has always given His Saints, wherever he had any on the earth, the same spirit, and that spirit, as John says, is the true spirit of prophecy, which is the testimony of Jesus. I may safely say that the word "Mormon" stands independent of the wisdom and learning of this generation. * * * *</p>
<p>The word Mormon, means literally, more good.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Joseph Smith</p>
<p>Mr. Joseph H. Jackson representing himself as being out of employment and destitute of funds, he desired I would employ him and relieve his necessities. I took compassion and employed him as a clerk to sell lands, so as to give him a chance in the world.</p>
<p><strong>The Prophet's Reproof of the People.</strong></p>
<p><em>Sunday, 21.--</em>At half-past ten a.m. I arrived at the Temple, and had to press my way through the crowd in the aisles to get to the stand, when I remarked that there were some people who thought it a terrible thing that anybody should exercise a little power. I thought it a pity that anybody should give occasion to have power exercised, and requested the people to keep out of the aisles; for if they did not, I might some time run up and down and hit some of them; and called on two constables to keep the aisles clear.</p>
<p>After singing and prayer, I read 1st chapter of 2nd Epistle of Peter, and preached thereon. [The following synopsis was written by Dr. Willard Richards.]</p>
<p><a name="401" id="401"></a>[Page 401]</p>
<p>The Prophet's Discourse from 2 Peter, First Chapter--Reproof of Self-Righteousness.</p>
<p>I do not know when I shall have the privilege of speaking in a house large enough to convene the people. I find my lungs are failing with continual preaching in the open air to large assemblies.</p>
<p>I do not think there have been many good men on the earth since the days of Adam; but there was one good man and his name was Jesus. Many persons think a prophet must be a great deal better than anybody else. Suppose I would condescend--yes, I will call it condescend, to be a great deal better than any of you, I would be raised up to the highest heaven; and who should I have to accompany me?</p>
<p>I love that man better who swears a stream as long as my arm yet deals justice to his neighbors and mercifully deals his substance to the poor, than the long, smooth-faced hypocrite.</p>
<p>I do not want you to think that I am very righteous, for I am not. God judges men according to the use they make of the light which He gives them.</p>
<p>"We have a more sure word of prophecy, whereunto you do well to take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place. We were eye witnesses of his majesty and heard the voice of his excellent glory." And what could be more sure? When He was transfigured on the mount, what could be more sure to them? Divines have been quarreling for ages about the meaning of this.</p>
<p>The Prophet's Characterization of Himself</p>
<p>I am like a huge, rough stone rolling down from a high mountain; and the only polishing I get is when some corner gets rubbed off by coming in contact with something else, striking with accelerated force against religious bigotry, priestcraft, lawyer-craft, doctor-craft, lying editors, suborned judges and jurors, and the authority of perjured executives, backed by mobs, blasphemers, licentious and corrupt men and women--all hell knocking off a corner here and a corner there. Thus I will become a smooth and polished shaft in the quiver of the Almighty, who will give me dominion over all and every one of them, when their refuge of lies shall fail, and their hiding place shall be destroyed, while these smooth-polished stones with which I come in contact become marred.</p>
<p><a name="401 - 402" id="401 - 402"></a>There are three grand secrets lying in this chapter, [<a class="scriplink" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/2_Pet/1/1#1">2 Peter 1</a>.] which no man can dig out, unless by the light of revelation, and which unlocks the whole chapter as the things that are written are only hints of things which existed in the prophet's mind, which are not written concerning eternal glory.</p>
<p><a name="402" id="402"></a>[Page 402]</p>
<p>I am going to take up this subject by virtue of the knowledge of God in me, which I have received from heaven. The opinions of men, so far as I am concerned, are to me as the crackling of thorns under the pot, or the whistling of the wind. I break the ground; I lead the way like Columbus when he was invited to a banquet, where he was assigned the most honorable place at the table, and served with the ceremonials which were observed towards sovereigns. A shallow courtier present, who was meanly jealous of him, abruptly asked him whether he thought that in case he had not discovered the Indies, there were not other men in Spain who would have been capable of the enterprise? Columbus made no reply, but took an egg and invited the company to make it stand on end. They all attempted it, but in vain; whereupon he struck it upon the table so as to break one end, and left it standing on the broken part, illustrating that when he had once shown the way to the new world nothing was easier than to follow it.</p>
<p>Paul ascended into the third heavens, and he could understand the three principal rounds of Jacob's ladder--the telestial, the terrestrial, and the celestial glories or kingdoms, where Paul saw and heard things which were not lawful for him to utter. I could explain a hundred fold more than I ever have of the glories of the kingdoms manifested to me in the vision, were I permitted, and were the people prepared to receive them.</p>
<p>The Lord deals with this people as a tender parent with a child, communicating light and intelligence and the knowledge of his ways as they can bear it. The inhabitants of the earth are asleep: they know not the day of their visitation. The Lord hath set the bow in the cloud for a sign that while it shall be seen, seed time and harvest, summer and winter shall not fail; but when it shall disappear, woe to that generation, for behold the end cometh quickly.</p>
<p><a name="402 - 403" id="402 - 403"></a>Calling and Election to be Made Sure.</p>
<p><a name="402 - 403" id="402 - 403"></a>Contend earnestly for the like precious faith with the Apostle Peter, "and add to your faith virtue," knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, charity; "for if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ." Another point, after having all these qualifications, he lays this injunction upon the people "to make your calling and election sure." He is emphatic upon this subject--after adding all this virtue, knowledge, &amp;c., "Make your calling and election sure." What is the secret--the starting point? "According as His divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness." How did he obtain all things? Through the knowledge of Him who hath called him. There could not anything be given, pertaining to life and godliness, without knowledge. Woe! woe! woe to Christendom!--especially the divines and priests if this be true.</p>
<p><a name="403" id="403"></a>[Page 403]</p>
<p>Salvation is for a man to be saved from all his enemies; for until a man can triumph over death, he is not saved. A knowledge of the priesthood alone will do this.</p>
<p>The spirits in the eternal world are like the spirits in this world. When those have come into this world and received tabernacles, then died and again have risen and received glorified bodies, they will have an ascendency over the spirits who have received no bodies, or kept not their first estate, like the devil. The punishment of the devil was that he should not have a habitation like men. The devil's retaliation is, he comes into this world, binds up men's bodies, and occupies them himself. When the authorities come along, they eject him from a stolen habitation.</p>
<p>The design of the great God in sending us into this world, and organizing us to prepare us for the eternal worlds, I shall keep in my own bosom at present.</p>
<p>We have no claim in our eternal compact, in relation to eternal things, unless our actions and contracts and all things tend to this end. But after all this, you have got to make your calling and election sure. If this injunction would lie largely on those to whom it was spoken, how much more those of the present generation!</p>
<p>1st key: Knowledge is the power of salvation. 2nd key: Make your calling and election sure. 3rd key: It is one thing to be on the mount and hear the excellent voice, &amp;c., &amp;c., and another to hear the voice declare to you, You have a part and lot in that kingdom.</p>
<p>Judge Adams arrived at my house from Springfield.</p>
<p><strong>Complaint against Benjamin Winchester.</strong></p>
<p><em>Monday, 22.--</em>Called at the office at nine, a.m., having received letters from Sisters Armstrong and Nicholson, of Philadelphia, complaining of the slanderous conduct of Benjamin Winchester; and I directed the Twelve Apostles to act upon the matter.</p>
<p>This morning received a large hickory walking stick having a silver head, with the motto "Beware."</p>
<p><a name="403 - 404" id="403 - 404"></a>Rode out to my farm; dined at Cornelius P. Lott's; then rode to the Lima road, and returned home at half-past seven, p.m.</p>

<p>The Prophet on Forming Temperance Societies.</p>
<p>Dear Brother:--In answer to yours of May 4th, concerning the Latter-day Saints' forming a temperance society, we would say, as Paul said--"Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers, but contend for the faith once delivered to the Saints;" and as Peter advises, so say we, "Add to your knowledge, temperance." As Paul said he had to become all things to all men, that he might thereby save some, so must the elders of the last days do; and, being sent out to preach the Gospel and warn the world of the judgments to come, we are sure, when they teach as directed by the Spirit, according to the revelations of Jesus Christ, that they will preach the truth and prosper without complaint. Thus we have no new commandment to give, but admonish elders and members to live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God, lest they come short of the glory that is reserved for the faithful.</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 23--</em>In conversation with Judge Adams and others.</p>
<p>At eight a.m., rode out to visit the sick.</p>
<p>Two p.m. Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Parley P. Pratt, Orson Pratt, Orson Hyde, Wilford Woodruff, John Taylor, George A. Smith, Willard Richards and others met in the office.</p>
<p>Elder Addison Pratt was ordained a seventy and blessed and set apart to go to the Society Islands, by President Brigham Young, assisted by Heber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde, Parley P. Pratt,--that he should be a swift messenger to the nations of the earth, have power over the elements, and not fear when tempests arise. "Do not be hasty and passionate, but acknowledge goodness in all, where you find it. Hearken ye, they will say, one to another, to this man; and they will carry you and give presents, etc., you shall have power over the ship's course, and shall return again to this land and rejoice with your family, if you are faithful."</p>
<p><a name="405" id="405"></a>[Page 405]</p>
<p>Elder Noah Rogers, of the Seventies, was blessed by the same brethren, Elder Kimball being mouth. It was said that he might have power to discern between good and evil, be filled with the power of God, have faith to heal the sick, cast out devils, and cause the lame to walk, and have the heavens opened, and have an appointment from on high, even from God, if he was faithful. "Except thou art willing to be led, thou shalt never lead. Thou shalt return to this place." He was set apart to accompany Brother Addison Pratt to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Elder Benjamin Grouard was ordained a seventy by the same brethren, Orson Hyde mouth. Prayed that the angel of God might watch over him and deliver him from his enemies and the tempests and troubles of the sea, that he might perform the mission with honor to himself, and return in safety.</p>
<p>Elder Knowlton F. Hanks was also set apart to the islands.</p>
<p>Reuben Hedlock, high priest, was blessed and set apart to go to England.</p>
<p>Other Ordinations and Appointments.</p>
<p>Elder John Cairnes was ordained high priest and set apart to accompany Brother Hedlock.</p>
<p>President Young said to Brother Addison Pratt and his associates: We commit the keys of opening the gospel to the Society Islands to you, when all the Twelve said, Aye.</p>
<p>Elder Rogers was appointed president of the mission.</p>
<p>Reuben Hedlock's mission was to preside over the churches in England, over the emigration, and over business in general, by vote of the quorum.</p>
<p>Elder Young said he wanted the funds in Liverpool to pay the passage of those who were expected to be sent for by Brother John Benbow and his wife, on account of moneys lent by him to commence the printing of the Book of Mormon, <em>Millennial Star</em>, Hymn Book, etc., and to send the worthy poor to this country, and let Brother Hedlock use what is necessary for his own convenience; and voted unanimously that the foregoing be carried into execution.</p>
<p>Let the Books of Mormon be sold as fast as they can in England, and the avails be retained by Elder Hedlock till further orders.</p>
<p><a name="406" id="406"></a>[Page 406]</p>
<p>Voted that Sister Ann Dawson and her family, William Bradbury with his family, Brother Leech, of Preston, and his family, Brother Anderson, of Stoke-upon-Trent, and all the poor Saints be brought over to this country.</p>
<p>Voted on reading Elder Ward's letters of March 4th and 16th to the First Presidency and Twelve, that the printing in England be stopped, according to previous instructions, and Elders Thomas Ward and Amos Fielding come to this place, and the funds referred to in Elder Ward's letter be expended by Elder Hedlock, as before stated.</p>
<p><strong>First Contribution to the Nauvoo Museum.</strong></p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 24.--</em>Elder Addison Pratt presented the tooth of a whale, coral, bones of an Albatross' wing and skin of a foot, jaw-bone of a porpoise, and tooth of a South Sea seal as the beginning for a museum in Nauvoo.</p>
<p>I bought eleven quarter-sections of land from Judge Adams, and then rode out on the hill.</p>
<p>I find in the <em>Boston Bee </em>of this date a letter; and as it is so remarkable that any editor will publish anything in the columns of his paper concerning me or the Saints but slander, I take pleasure in transcribing the following:</p>
<p><a name="406 - 407" id="406 - 407"></a>A Character Sketch of the Prophet--His Doctrine of Inspiration.</p>
<p><a name="406 - 407" id="406 - 407"></a>Sir, in bygone years, and long before I heard of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and indeed before he had existence, I had formed some very curious ideas about the ancient prophets. From reading their history in the Bible, I supposed they must have been men of no ordinary proportions; or, if so, that there was something about them different from other men, by which they might be distinguished at sight. As a matter of course. I thought they must have had gray hairs for a covering to make them appear very dignified, and beards as long as a Jew's; for if they shaved, it would show that they were men; and could I have had the privilege of looking at one, I should have expected to have seen him clad in sheep, goat, bear or wolf skin, wandering about on the mountains like the beasts he had robbed of their garment, lodging in the caves and dens of the earth, and subsisting on the fruits and nuts of the forest,--a being too holy, too sanctified, too exalted by his high calling, to appear in the habitations or among the society of men, unless he had some important message to communicate direct from heaven--some revelation or commandment to promulgate to his fellows; and then he would just come forth and cry out, like the beasts in the wilderness, with so much sacred sanctity, that everybody would know he was a prophet, and if by nothing else, when they saw his nails like birds' claws, and his hairs like eagles' feathers and his hands and face as filthy as a baboon; for it never occurred to me that clean hands, in administering before the Lord, as mentioned in the scripture, meant anything more than a good conscience; and I had never supposed but that a man could worship God just as acceptably all covered with dirt, and filth and slime, as though he had bathed in Siloam every hour, until I heard the Mormon prophet lecturing his people on the subject of neatness and cleanliness, teaching them that all was clean in heaven, and that Jesus was going to make the place of His feet glorious; and if the Mormons did not keep their feet out of the ashes, they could not stand with Him on Mount Zion.</p>
<p><a name="407" id="407"></a>[Page 407]</p>
<p>I had no thought before but that dirty people could get to heaven as well as clean ones; and that if the priests ordered sacrifices with polluted hands, the fire would cleans; both the offering and the hands that offered it. I cannot say how much there may be in scripture to contradict my views, neither can I vouch for it that the churches of the day believe any such doctrine; for I never belonged to any of them, but have rather been called an infidel. As to that, I have not altered much. I like consistency, find it where I may.</p>
<p>With all these curious notions I fell into the Mormon settlement, and saw the prophet; but having never heard a Mormon preach, you can imagine me not quite ready to receive all the impressions incident to an interview with such a distinguished personage. But I will give it as I find it, hit or miss the faith or feelings of any one. I have had an interview view since my last, and found anything but the truth in the current reports. "The Prophet Joseph" (as he is called among his people) said in a conversation with a gentleman present, that he no more professed to be a prophet than every man must who professes to be a preacher of righteousness or a minister of the new testament.</p>
<p>To be a minister of Jesus, a man must testify of Jesus; and to testify of Jesus, a man must have the spirit of prophecy; for, according to John, the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</p>
<p><a name="407 - 408" id="407 - 408"></a>If a man professes to be a minister of Jesus and has not the spirit of prophecy, he must be a false witness, for he is not in possession of that gift which qualifies him for that office; and the difference between him and the clergy of this generation is, he claims to be in possession of that spirit of prophecy which qualifies him to testify of Jesus and the Gospel of salvation; and the clergy deny that spirit, even the spirit of prophecy, which alone could constitute them true witnesses or testators of the Lord Jesus, and yet claim to be true ministers of salvation.</p>
<p><a name="408" id="408"></a>[Page 408]</p>
<p>In this, said he, I am honest, and they are dishonest, and that is the difference between us. Were they true and honest witnesses of Jesus Christ, they would acknowledge they have the testimony of Him, and that is the spirit of prophecy; and every man who possesses that spirit is a prophet.</p>
<p>I, said he, claim no more than what every servant of Christ must possess to qualify him for his office, while the clergy of the 19th century deny that which alone could constitute what they profess to be. He said he did not profess to be a very good man, but acknowledged himself a sinner like other men, or, as all men are, imperfect; and it is necessary for all men to grow into the stature of manhood in the Gospel.</p>
<p>I could not help noticing that he dressed, talked and acted like other men, and in every respect exactly the opposite of what I had conjured up in my imagination a prophet.</p>
<p>The Mormons have not yet completed their great Temple, and have no commodious place of worship; but the apostles and elders preach in private houses on the Sabbath and at other times, though I seldom attended these latter meetings. But when the weather will admit they meet in the grove, or on the rough floor of the basement of the Temple, and then the prophet frequently preaches. On one of these occasion I heard him preach concerning the prodigal son.</p>
<p>After naming his text, the prophet remarked that some one had asked him the meaning of the expression of Jesus--"Among those born of women, there has not arisen a greater than John;" and said he had promised to answer it in public, and he would do it then. It could not have been on account of the miracles John performed, for he did no miracles; but it was--First, because he was trusted with a divine mission of preparing the way before the face of the Lord. Who was trusted with such a mission before or since? No man. Second, he was trusted and it was required at his hands to baptize the Son of Man. Who ever did that? Who ever had so great a privilege or glory? Who ever led the Son of God into the waters of baptism, beholding the Holy Ghost descend upon him in the sign of a dove? No man. Third, John at that time was the only legal administrator holding the keys of power there was on earth. The keys, the kingdom, the power, the glory had departed from the Jews; and John, the son of Zachariah, by the holy anointing and decree of heaven, held the keys of power at that time.</p>

<p><strong>Labors of Elder H. Tate.</strong></p>
<p>Elder H. Tate writes that in Cuba, Illinois, the people were anxious to hear him, when the Rev. John Rigdon, a Campbellite preacher refused to let him preach in the chapel, because Elder Tate was "sent by the authority of Jesus Christ," saying,</p>
<p>"That recommend will not do, for the world has condemned it already;" but at Pekin, Elder Tate baptized six in twelve days, and many more were favorable.</p>
<p><strong>Complaints against the Laws and Dr. Foster.</strong></p>
<p>Received a long letter from Thomas Rancliff, complaining of William and Wilson Law and Dr. Foster's swindling him, which is another example that people will not obey counsel, although it was so pointedly made known to the people on the 13th of April last.</p>
<p><em>Thursday, 25.--</em>Sent William Clayton to Carthage to redeem the city lots on the Galland tract, which had been sold for taxes.</p>
<p>Dr. Imbert, Messrs. Chastan and Manlan, missionaries, with seventy Christians were beheaded, and one hundred and eighty strangled in Korea, East Asia.</p>
<p>The town of Tallahassee, Florida, was destroyed by fire.</p>
<p><em>Friday, 26.--</em>At five p.m. I met in counsel in the upper room, with my brother Hyrum, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Willard Richards, Judge James Adams, Bishop Newel K. Whitney and William Law, and gave them their endowments and also instructions in the priesthood on the new and everlasting covenant, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Wrote a letter of instructions to Reuben Hedlock.</p>

<p><a name="409 - 410" id="409 - 410"></a><strong>Benjamin Winchester Investigated.</strong></p>
<p><a name="409 - 410" id="409 - 410"></a>At two p.m. I met brother Hyrum, the Twelve, Judge Adams, Bishop Whitney and others, in council to investigate the conduct of Benjamin Winchester, charges having been preferred against him by letter from Sybella Armstrong and others in Philadelphia, Sisters Jarman and Adams. George J. Adams and others gave their testimony, when they disfellowshiped Winchester, and took his license until he made satisfaction to the aggrieved parties.</p>
<p><a name="410" id="410"></a>[Page 410]</p>
<p>[Extract from Wilford's Woodruff's journal.]</p>
<p>Elder Wilford Woodruff's Minutes of the Investigation of Benjamin Winchester.</p>
<p>A rainy day.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I met in council with the Twelve and First Presidency, when the case of Benjamin Winchester was brought up on trial for improper conduct, slandering the Saints in Philadelphia, for rejecting the counsel of Hyrum, Joseph and the Twelve, and tearing to pieces the Saints instead of building them up.</p>
<p>Hyrum pleaded for mercy, Joseph for justice, and the Twelve decided according to testimony; and in all we had an interesting time. Elder Winchester was refractory and out of order. President Joseph Smith wished the Twelve or president of the quorum to call the house to order.</p>
<p>Several letters were read touching the subject; after which Elder Winchester made a lengthy speech trying to justify himself. Was followed by President Hyrum Smith, who pleaded in behalf of Winchester on the side of mercy.</p>
<p>Elder George J. Adams gave his testimony against Winchester; then Elder Winchester followed Adams, and both spoke several times. Then President Joseph Smith arose and rebuked Elder Winchester in the sharpest manner; said he had a lying spirit and had lied about him. and told him of many of his errors.</p>
<p>After hearing the testimony, Elder Brigham Young, president of the quorum of the Twelve, said he had made up his mind, and his decision was that Elder Winchester should give up his license and cease preaching until he should reform.</p>
<p>President Hyrum Smith said he should not like to have such a decision given without another trial and giving Elder Winchester a chance to get more testimony if he could.</p>
<p>President Brigham Young said he should then prefer to have the case turned over to the high council.</p>
<p>President Joseph Smith said it was not the business of the high council. They could not try him. It belonged to the Twelve, and them alone; for it was concerning matters abroad, and not in Nauvoo. The high council was to try cases that belong to the stake, and the Twelve to regulate the churches and elders abroad in all the world; and Elder Winchester's case comes under the jurisdiction of the Twelve and theirs alone.</p>
<p><a name="411" id="411"></a>[Page 411]</p>
<p>President Hyrum Smith urged that the case should be put off until tomorrow. President Joseph Smith said that the case might be put off until tomorrow at ten o'clock, if it would do anybody any good.</p>
<p>President Brigham Young arose and spoke in the majesty of his calling; and among other remarks, said that his mind was made up, and that the remarks of Brother Hyrum or of Brother Joseph had not altered it. As for himself, he would not sit upon the case another day. He considered the course Brother Winchester had taken an insult upon his office and calling as an apostle of Jesus Christ, and he would not bear it. As for the rest of the Twelve, they might do as they pleased. As for himself, he would not submit to it. Benjamin Winchester has despised and rejected the counsel of the Presidency and the Twelve--has said they had no jurisdiction over him in Philadelphia, and to say where he should go, &amp;c. But he and others will find there is power in the Twelve. We know through whom we have received our power and who are our benefactors, and we are thankful for it. Benjamin Winchester has never for the first time received our counsel, but has gone contrary to it. No one is safe in his hands. He calls Hyrum an old granny, and slanders everybody. He says there is a contradiction between Hyrum and the Twelve. There is no contradiction between Hyrum and the Twelve--is there, Brother Hyrum? [Hyrum answered "No."]</p>
<p>After Brigham Young closed, President Joseph Smith said he would give us a little counsel, if we saw fit to accept it. He thought it proper for us to silence Elder Winchester, take his license and have him bring his family to Nauvoo; and if he would not do that, let him go out of the Church.</p>
<p>It was then moved and seconded that Elder Winchester be silenced, and give up his license, and come with his family to Nauvoo. The motion was carried unanimously.</p>
<p>Brother Joseph then addressed the Twelve, and said that in all our counsels, especially while on trial of any one, we should see and observe all things appertaining to the subject, and discern the spirit by which either party was governed. We should be in a situation to understand every spirit and judge righteous judgment and not be asleep. We should keep order and not let the council be imposed upon by unruly conduct. The Saints need not think because I am familiar with them and am playful and cheerful, that I am ignorant of what is going on. Iniquity of any kind cannot be sustained in the Church, and it will not fare well where I am; for I am determined while I do lead the Church, to lead it right.</p>
<p><a name="411 - 412" id="411 - 412"></a>Brother Joseph further remarked, concerning Elder Adams, that he had given satisfaction to him concerning the thing whereof he was accused. He had confessed all wherein he had done wrong, and had asked for mercy, and he had taken the right course to save himself; that he would now begin anew in the Church.</p>
<p><a name="412" id="412"></a>[Page 412]</p>
<p>After much instruction was given from Joseph, the council adjourned.</p>
<p>I then instructed the Twelve to investigate the condition of the whole Philadelphia church while in council.</p>
