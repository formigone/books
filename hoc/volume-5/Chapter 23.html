<p>About forty Saints arrived from Peterboro, New Hampshire.</p>
<p><strong>Departure of the Prophet for Dixon, Lee Co., Ill.</strong></p>
<p><em>Thursday, 13.--</em>I started north with Emma and the children to see her sister, Mrs. Wasson and family, living near Dixon, Lee county, Illinois.<br />
Elder Wilford Woodruff, when going to the prairie with several brethren to fence his five-acre lot, broke the reach of his wagon and it fell into a pile together. The wheel fell on his arm and bruised him considerably; but he was able to mend his wagon and continue his journey. After working hard all day he went to Brother Cheney's house to obtain a drink of water, when an ugly dog bit him through the calf of the leg, which made him very lame.</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 14.--</em>Business is progressing. Buildings are going up in every direction, and the citizens manifest a determination that Nauvoo shall be built up. The stones of the Temple begin to rise tier upon tier, and it already presents a stately and noble appearance.</p>
<p>The Mississippi has been rising three or four days, and is now three or four inches above high water mark.</p>
<p><a name="431 - 432" id="431 - 432"></a><em>Thursday, 15.--</em>We give the following extract from the <em>Salem Advertiser and Argus, </em>being an extract from a lecture delivered in Salem by Mr. J. B. Newhall:</p>
<p><a name="432" id="432"></a>[Page 432]</p>
<p>Synopsis of a Lecture Delivered in Salem, on Nauvoo and the Prophet.</p>
<p>The Nauvoo Temple is a very singular and unique structure. It is one hundred and fifty feet in length, ninety-eight feet wide, and when finished will be one hundred and fifty feet high. It is different from anything in ancient or modern history. Everything about it is on a magnificent scale, and when finished and seen from the opposite side of the river, will present one, if not the most beautiful, chaste and noble specimens of architecture to be found in the world.</p>
<p>We should like to be in possession of a model of this building, both on account of its great notoriety as being connected with the Mormon or Latter-day Saints' religion and also a work of art.</p>
<p>Did our limits here permit, we might give a very minute description of the whole order of architecture. The splendid drawing was executed by Mr. Newhall, while in Nauvoo, from a copy in the archives of that city. We wish he had taken it on a large scale, but he probably did not on account of transportation. We regret exceedingly that we did not have the privilege of a near inspection of the map of the city of Nauvoo, the place which for some time past has created more intense interest, perhaps, than any other city, town or village in the country, if not in the world. But on enquiring for it, we found it had been rolled up and packed away.</p>
<p>He gave a very glowing and interesting account of this city. The location is one of the most beautiful upon earth, situated upon the Mississippi river, rising in an inclined plane till it reaches the height where it overlooks an extensive tract of territory, unrivaled in rich and varying scenery.</p>
<p>His account of the military displays in Nauvoo, where Smith's Legion, as it is called, turns out, is very interesting and exciting. He spoke of the six ladies on horses, with white feathers or plumes waving over black velvet, riding up and down in front of the Legion. This must appear singular, at least to a Yankee.</p>
<p>He has had personal interviews with Joseph; and to sum up his character in a word, he is a jolly fellow, and according to his view, he is one of the last persons on earth whom God would have raised up as a prophet or priest, he is so diametrically opposite to that which he ought to be in order to merit the titles or to act in such offices. Among others he is very sociable, cheerful, kind and obliging, and very hospitable.</p>
<p>We have seen Hyrum Smith, a brother of Joseph's, and heard him preach, and conversed with him about his religion, its origin and progress; and we heard him declare in this city, in public, that what is recorded about the plates is God's solemn truth.</p>
<p><a name="433" id="433"></a>[Page 433]</p>
<p>He declared to us in the Masonic Hall, in this city, that the statements are true, and called upon God with uplifted hands as a witness. We think it would be very interesting to the good people of Salem, and in fact to the whole Eastern States, to have the prophet come and make us a visit. We very much doubt whether there is a man on earth who would create so much excitement and deep interest at least for the time being, as the prophet.</p>
<p>The<em> Times and Seasons </em>of this date has the following:</p>
<p>Calamities of 1843, up to June.</p>
<p>The past year has been distinguished by calamities. In some instances the elements seem to have been commissioned to perform the work of destruction to an awful extent and unprecedented severity.</p>
<p>Three of the greatest calamities that have occurred within a century, happened within the short period of one hundred hours. The terrible fire at Hamburg, which destroyed two thousand houses, and nearly thirty million dollars of property, in the fairest portion of the city, was followed in less than two days by the earthquake at St. Domingo. In this earthquake the towns of Haytien and Santiago, sixty miles apart, were entirely destroyed, and not less than seven thousand five hundred of the inhabitants perished.</p>
<p>On the very next day, while St. Domingo was yet rocking with the shocks of the earthquake, and the ruins of Hamburg were not three days old, a train of cars filled with passengers on the railroad from Paris to Versailles were thrown from the track and set on fire by the engine. Before the passengers, who were locked in, could be removed, seventy of them perished in the flames.</p>
<p>More recently the city of Liverpool has suffered by fire to an extent only surpassed by the fire at Hamburg.</p>
<p>In this country, the cities of Portland, New York, Charleston, and Columbia have suffered severely from the same cause.</p>
<p>At one period of several weeks during the year it was estimated that the loss of steamboats on the western waters averaged one a day. In connection with six of the boats, two hundred lives were lost. If to all this we add the loss of life at sea, which has been unusually great the Past year, we must regard it as a year of calamities.</p>
<p><strong>Another Arrest of the Prophet Threatened.</strong></p>
<p><em>Friday, 16.--</em>Judge James Adams wrote by express from Springfield, at ten p.m., that Governor Thomas Ford had told him that he was going to issue a writ for me on the requisition of the Governor of Missouri, and that it would start tomorrow.</p>
<p><a name="434" id="434"></a>[Page 434]</p>
<p>I copy the following from the<em> Neighbor. </em></p>
<p>Proscription Against the Jews.</p>
<p>At the very moment when a spirit of toleration seemed to influence the feelings of society throughout the civilized world, we regret to perceive that the tribunals of the pope are, in June, 1843, reviving at Rome and Ancona, the very worst proscriptions of that fell and sanguinary institute, the Inquisition, as will be seen by a perusal of the following document:</p>
<p>"We, Fra Vincenzo Salina, of the order of Predicatori, Master in Theology, General Inquisitor in Ancona, Singaglia, Jesi, Osino, Cingoli, Macerata, Tolentino, Loreta, Recanati, and other towns and districts, &amp;c.</p>
<p>"It being deemed necessary to revive the full observance of the disciplinary laws relative to the Israelites residing within our jurisdiction, and having hitherto without effect employed prayers and exhortation to obtain obedience to those laws in the Ghetti (Jewries) of Ancona and Sinigaglia, authorized by the despatch of the Sacred and Supreme Inquisition of Rome, dated June 10, 1843, expressly enjoining and commanding the observance of the decrees and pontificial constitutions, especially in respect to Christian nurses and domestic servants, or to the sale of property either in town or country districts, purchased and possessed previously to 1827, as well as subsequently to that period, we decree as follows:</p>
<p>"1. From the interval of two months after the date of this day, all gipsy and Christian domestics, male and female, whether employed by day or by night, must be dismissed from service in the said two Ghetti; and all Jews residing within our jurisdiction are expressly prohibited from employing any Christian nurse, or availing themselves of the services of any Christian in any domestic occupation whatever under pain of being immediately punished according to the pontifical constitutions.</p>
<p>"2. That all Jews who may possess property either in town or country permanent or moveable, or rents or interest, or any right involving shares in funded property, or leased landed property, must, within the term of three months from this day dispose of it by a positive and real, and not by any pretended or fictitious contract. Should this not be done within the time specified, the holy office is to sell the same by auction, on proof of the annual harvest being got in.</p>
<p><a name="434 - 435" id="434 - 435"></a>"3. That no Hebrew nurses, and still less any Hebrew family, shall inhabit the city, or reside in or remove their property into any town or district where there is no Ghetto (place or residence for Jews); and that such as may actually be there in conformity to the laws must return to their respective Ghetto within the peremptory period of six months, otherwise they will be proceeded against according to the tenor of the law.</p>
<p><a name="435" id="435"></a>[Page 435]</p>
<p>"4. That especially in any city where there is a Ghetto, no Hebrew must presume to associate at table with Christians, either in public houses or ordinaries, out of the Ghetto.</p>
<p>"5. That in a city which has a Ghetto, no Hebrew shall sleep out of the Israelite quarter, nor make free to enter into familiar conversation in a Christian house.</p>
<p>"6. That no Hebrew shall take the liberty, under any pretext whatever to induce male Christians, and still less female Christians, to sleep within the boundaries of the Ghetto.</p>
<p>"7. That no Hebrews shall hire Christians, even only by the day, to work in their houses in the Ghetto.</p>
<p>"8. That no Hebrew, either male or female, shall frequent the houses of Christians, or maintain friendly relations with Christian men or women.</p>
<p>"9. That the laws shall remain in force respecting the decorum to be observed by the Hebrews who may absent themselves from their Ghetto to travel in the other parts of the state."</p>
<p>After laying down their monstrous rescripts, which we had hoped even the Romish church would not have attempted to revive, and still less reclothe with authority, and arm with tremendous pains and penalties, the savage order is issued that these intolerant laws shall be read in each of the Jewish synagogues. It is added, "They who violate the above articles will incur some or all of the penalties prescribed in the edicts of the Holy Inquisition."</p>
<p><em>Saturday, 17.--</em>The<em> Maid of Iowa </em>went to Shokoquon with the Temple hands on a pleasure excursion. While there, the steamer <em>Shokoquon </em>came to port with many citizens from Burlington, when Elder George A. Smith delivered a lecture.</p>
<p><em>Sunday, 18.--</em>Meeting at the Temple. Elder Eli P. Maginn preached in the forepart of the day, to the edification of the Saints. The sacrament was administered in the afternoon.</p>
<p><a name="435 - 436" id="435 - 436"></a><strong>Markham and Clayton Sent to Warn the Prophet.</strong></p>
<p><a name="435 - 436" id="435 - 436"></a>Judge Adams' message arrived early in the evening, when my Brother Hyrum sent William Clayton and Stephen Markham as fast as possible to inform me. Markham had two hundred and fifty dollars, and Clayton borrowed two hundred dollars.</p>
<p><a name="436" id="436"></a>[Page 436]</p>
<p>They left Nauvoo about half-past twelve at night, and proceeded to La Harpe.</p>
<p>Elder Elijah F. Sheets writes that he and Joseph A. Stratton have been preaching in Illinois, Indiana and Pennsylvania since September 4, 1842; have baptized thirty-two, and many more are convinced of the truth of the work; and that they are continuing their labors.</p>
<p><strong>Progress of Markham and Clayton.</strong></p>
<p><em>Monday, 19.--</em>The laborers held a meeting in the grove to investigate the price and principles of labor.</p>
<p>Clayton and Markham arrived at La Harpe at sunrise, tarried about two hours to get a horse shod and take breakfast; started again at seven for Monmouth, where they arrived at three p.m., and put up their horses to feed and rest. They took dinner and slept till seven, when they started again and rode till midnight, when, the horses being tired and weary, they turned them out to feed, and they themselves lay down to sleep about two hours; after which they again resumed their journey and rode one mile north of Hendersonville, where they stopped to feed their horses.</p>
<p><strong>Markham and Clayton Arrive at Portland.</strong></p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 20.--</em>About half-past seven, a.m., Markham and Clayton again started on their journey, and arrived at Andover about ten a.m. They turned out their horses to graze in the woods for about half-an-hour, when they proceeded to Gennesseo, where they arrived at half-past two p.m. They tried to hire a pair of horses to continue their journey, but did not succeed. They left Gennesseo, at six p.m., and traveled to Portland, where they arrived at twelve, put up their horses, and went to bed until four a.m.</p>
<p>The following appears in the <em>Nauvoo Neighbor, </em>and serves to illustrate the benefit of chartered rights in Illinois :</p>
<p><a name="436 - 437" id="436 - 437"></a>Projected Industries at Nauvoo Menaced by Portending Legislation.</p>
<p><a name="436 - 437" id="436 - 437"></a>Sir:--In obedience to the call made in your paper for information in relation to the affairs of the Agricultural and Manufacturing Association of this city, I give you such facts as I think will be satisfactory.</p>
<p><a name="437" id="437"></a>[Page 437]</p>
<p>The first great object of the company was to establish a pottery for the manufacturing of the various kinds of crockery in common use in the country. Persons were deputed to make the necessary search whether suitable materials could be obtained.</p>
<p>The persons who were employed in this service were such as had been employed all their lives in the business. Their report was favorable, having found all the materials of as good a quality as those used in the old world for that purpose, in the immediate vicinity.</p>
<p>Efforts were accordingly made to commence the business with as little delay as possible. An eligible situation was obtained and the work of building commenced.</p>
<p>A stone building of sufficient size was put under construction and progressed with much rapidity. Persons possessing means felt desirous of investing a part of them at least in the business. All was prosperous and all flattering.</p>
<p>A considerable amount of land was obtained for agricultural purposes, it being the wish of the managers to supply all their workmen with all their necessaries as far as could be. Arrangements were making to get stock of the various kinds for this purpose.</p>
<p>The building had progressed nearly to the height of one story, when the electioneering campaign commenced, and it was roundly asserted that if certain persons were elected, all the charters granted by a previous legislature to the citizens of Nauvoo would be repealed.</p>
<p>At first the association supposed that this was merely an electioneering intrigue. But it assumed a formidable appearance, and began to assume the character of a fixed determination to carry the design into execution.</p>
<p>The subsequent acts of the legislature have given but too much evidence that such was the real intention of a very considerable portion of the members of the last legislature, if not a majority of them. This instantly paralyzed the exertions of the company. Many who were about to contribute to the funds of the society paused, not knowing what was best; and in consequence the work stopped.</p>
<p>Not that the company supposed that there was any such power vested in the legislature, either in the constitution or common sense; but they did not know how far a reckless spirit might lead men in the violation of both.</p>
<p>As the matter now stands, those having capital are at a loss whether to invest it in that way or not, lest the same reckless spirit may inevitably carry the proposed design into effect.</p>
<p><a name="437 - 438" id="437 - 438"></a>The work has not stopped for want of means or materials to carry on the business, as means, materials, and workmen of the first order are all at hand. But where is the safety, while such doctrines are boldly maintained by our legislature?</p>
<p><a name="438" id="438"></a>[Page 438]</p>
<p>All the prospects of the company may be blasted at any stage of their business by one single act of men who seem to have no interest in the prosperity of the state or the citizens thereof, apart from their own political preferment.</p>
<p>Pledges can be made, for the sake of preferment, to an ignorant constituency to commit the most flagrant abuses upon the rights of private companies or even individuals, and attempts made with zeal and determination to carry them out to the full extent.</p>
<p>If public confidence be restored, the work can go on mote vigorously than ever.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Sidney Rigdon,</p>
<p>President of the Company.</p>
<p><strong>Donations to the Temple.</strong></p>
<p>Elder John Snider reported the names of various persons in Great Britain and Ireland who donated various small sums between May and December, 1842, as contributions for building the Temple, and paid over nine hundred and seventy-five dollars and four cents. The names of the donors and amounts are recorded in the "Law of the Lord."</p>
<p><strong>Generosity of Earl Spencer.</strong></p>
<p>I insert the following as an exception to the general rule:--Earl Spencer keeps all the poor in the parish of Wormleighton, England, and so prevents a poor rate. He allows his laborers nine shillings a week when out of employment, and they pay only a shilling a year as a nominal rent for the house in which they severally reside.</p>
<p><a name="438 - 439" id="438 - 439"></a><strong>Meeting of the Prophet with Markham and Clayton.</strong></p>
<p><a name="438 - 439" id="438 - 439"></a><em>Wednesday, 21.--</em>Markham and Clayton left Portland at four a.m., and traveled to within nine miles of Dixon. They changed their course, and went direct to Inlet Grove, where they arrived at half-past twelve, took dinner and fed their horses. Left Inlet at two p.m., and arrived at Wasson's at four p.m., where they learned that I was gone to Dixon in the carriage; and although their horses were tired down, they started for Dixon, but met me about half way.</p>
<p><a name="439" id="439"></a>[Page 439]</p>
<p>They returned with me to Wasson's, and were glad to find a resting place, having ridden two hundred and twelve miles in sixty-six hours and had very little rest on the way; the horses were tired,--their backs very sore. I told them not to be alarmed. "I have no fear. I shall not leave here: I shall find friends, and Missourians cannot hurt me, I tell you in the name of Israel's God."</p>
<p><em>Thursday, 22.--</em>Another meeting of the laborers in the grove near the temple concerning wages.</p>
<p><strong>Postponement of the Prophet's Appointment at Dixon.</strong></p>
<p>I had previously given out an appointment to preach this day at Dixon, but on account of the change in circumstances, I wrote to Dixon, telling the people there was a writ out for me, and therefore declined preaching; and I kept myself quiet all day, telling my friends that if I started for home I might be arrested where I had no friends and be kidnapped into Missouri, and thought it best to tarry at Inlet and see the result. Many [at Dixon] were desirous to hear me preach, but were disappointed.</p>
<p>Lawyer Edward Southwick, of Dixon, having heard of the writ being out against me, rode twelve miles to inform me. I thanked him for his kindness, paid him twenty-five dollars and introduced him to my friends, Markham and Clayton, showing that I had received previous information.</p>
<p><em>Friday, 23.--</em>Judge Adams arrived at Nauvoo from Springfield.</p>
<p>At eight a.m. a company of the brethren gathered to remove the timbers from the Temple to the grove.</p>
<p><a name="439 - 440" id="439 - 440"></a>I sent William Clayton to Dixon at ten a.m., to try and find out what was going on there. He met Mr. Joseph B. Reynolds, the sheriff of Jackson county, Missouri, and Constable Harmon T. Wilson, of Carthage, Illinois, about half way, but they being disguised, they were not known by him; and when at Dixon they represented themselves as Mormon elders who wanted to see the prophet. They hired a man and team to carry them, for they had run their horses almost to death.</p>
<p><a name="440" id="440"></a>[Page 440]</p>
<p><strong>The Arrest at Dixon.</strong></p>
<p>They arrived at Mr. Wasson's while the family were at dinner, about two p.m. They came to the door and said they were Mormon elders, and wanted to see Brother Joseph. I was in the yard going to the barn when Wilson stepped to the end of the house and saw me. He accosted me in a very uncouth, ungentlemanly manner, when Reynolds stepped up to me, collared me, then both of them presented cocked pistols to my breast, without showing any writ or serving any process. Reynolds cried out, "G--d--you, if you stir I'll shoot; G--d--if you, stir one inch, I shoot you, be still, or I'll shoot you, by G--." I enquired "What is the meaning of all this?" "I'll show you the meaning, by G--; and if you stir one inch, I'll shoot you, G--d--you." I answered, "I am not afraid of your shooting; I am not afraid to die." I then bared my breast and told them to shoot away. "I have endured so much oppression, I am weary of life; and kill me, if you please. I am a strong man, however, and with my own natural weapons could soon level both of you; but if you have any legal process to serve, I am at all times subject to law, and shall not offer resistance." Reynold replied, "G--d--you, if you say another word I will shoot you, by G--." I answered, "Shoot away; I am not afraid of your pistols."</p>
<p><a name="440 - 441" id="440 - 441"></a><strong>Markham's Courage.</strong></p>
<p><a name="440 - 441" id="440 - 441"></a>By this time Stephen Markham walked deliberately towards us. When they saw him coming, they turned their pistols from me to him, and threatened his life if he came any nearer; but he paid no attention to their threats, and continued to advance nearer. They then turned their pistols on me again, jamming them against my side, with their fingers on the triggers, and ordered Markham to stand still or they would shoot me through. As Markham was advancing rapidly towards me, I said, "You are not going to resist the officers, are you, Brother Markham?" He replied, "No, not if they are officers: I know the law too well for that."</p>
<p><a name="441" id="441"></a>[Page 441]</p>
<p>They then hurried me off, put me in a wagon without serving any process, and were for hurrying me off without letting me see or bid farewell to my family or friends or even allowing me time to get my hat or clothes, or even suffer my wife or children to bring them to me. I then said, "Gentlemen, if you have any legal process, I wish to obtain a writ of habeas corpus," and was answered,--"G--d--you, you shan't have one." They still continued their punching me on both sides with their pistols.</p>
<p><strong>Brutality of the Arrest.</strong></p>
<p>Markham then sprung and seized the horses by the bits, and held them until my wife could bring my hat and coat. Reynolds and Wilson again threatening to shoot Markham, who said, "There is no law on earth that requires a sheriff to take a prisoner without his clothes." Fortunately at this moment I saw a man passing, and said to him, "These men are kidnapping me, and I wish a writ of habeas corpus to deliver myself out of their hands. But as he did not appear to go, I told Markham to go, and he immediately proceeded to Dixon on horseback, where the sheriff also proceeded with me at full speed, without even allowing me to speak to my family or bid them good bye. The officers held their pistols with the muzzles jamming into my side for more than eight miles, and they only desisted on being reproached by Markham for their cowardice in so brutally ill-treating an unarmed, defenseless prisoner. On arriving at the house of Mr. McKennie, the tavern-keeper, I was thrust into a room and guarded there, without being allowed to see anybody; and fresh horses were ordered to be ready in five minutes.</p>
<p><a name="441 - 442" id="441 - 442"></a>I again stated to Reynolds, "I wish to get counsel," when he answered. G--d--you, you shan't have counsel: one word more, G--d--you, and I'll shoot you." "What is the use of this so often?" said I. "I have repeatedly told you to shoot; and I now tell you again to shoot away!" I saw a person passing and shouted to him through the window, "I am falsely imprisoned here, and I want a lawyer. Lawyer Edward Southwick came, and had the door banged in his face, with the old threat of shooting him if he came any nearer.</p>
<p><a name="442" id="442"></a>[Page 442]</p>
<p>Another lawyer (Mr. Shepherd G. Patrick) afterwards came and received the same treatment, which began to cause considerable excitement in Dixon.</p>
<p>A Mr. Lucien P. Sanger asked Markham what was the matter, when he told him all, and stated that the sheriff intended to drag me away immediately to Missouri, and prevent my taking out a writ of habeas corpus.</p>
<p><strong>The Timely Interference of Mr. Dixon.</strong></p>
<p>Sanger soon made this known to Mr. Dixon, the owner of the house, and his friends, who gathered around the hotel door, and gave Reynolds to understand that if that was their mode of doing business in Missouri, they had another way of doing it in Dixon. They were a law-abiding people and Republicans, and gave Reynolds to understand that he should not take me away without giving me the opportunity of a fair trial, and that I should have justice done me; but that if he persisted in his course, they had a very summary way of dealing with such people.</p>
<p><a name="442 - 443" id="442 - 443"></a><strong>The Prophet's Appeal to the People of Dixon.</strong></p>
<p><a name="442 - 443" id="442 - 443"></a><strong>Cyrus H. Walker.</strong></p>
<p><a name="442 - 443" id="442 - 443"></a>Mr. Reynolds finding further resistance to be useless, allowed Mr. Patrick and Mr. Southwick to come into the room to me, (but Wilson was inside guarding the door, and Reynolds guarded the outside of the door,) when I told them I had been taken prisoner by these men without process; I had been insulted and abused by them. I showed them my flesh, which was black for about eighteen inches in circumference on each side, from their punching me with their pistols; and I wanted them to sue out a writ of habeas corpus, whereupon Reynolds swore he should only wait half-an-hour to give me a chance. A messenger was immediately sent by Mr. Dixon to Mr. Chamberlain, the Master-in-Chancery, who lived six miles distant, and, another message to Cyrus H. Walker, who happened to be near, to have them come down and get out the writ of habeas corpus.</p>
<p><a name="443" id="443"></a>[Page 443]</p>
<p>A writ was sued out by Markham before a justice of the peace against Reynolds and Wilson for threatening his life. They were taken into custody by the constable. He sued out another writ for assault and threatening my life, whereupon they were again arrested.</p>
<p>At this time Markham rushed into the room and put a pistol (unobserved) into my pocket, although Reynolds and Wilson had their pistols cocked at the same time and were threatening to shoot him.</p>
<p>About midnight he sued out a writ for a violation of the law in relation to writs of habeas corpus, Wilson having transferred me to the custody of Reynolds, for the purpose of dragging me to Missouri, and thereby avoiding the effect and operation of said writ, contrary to law, which was put over to be heard at ten o'clock tomorrow morning; and I was conducted back to the room and guarded through the night.</p>
<p><strong>Legion Enlargement.</strong></p>
<p>The 5th legion, 2nd cohort, Nauvoo Legion, consisting of four companies, organized. Hosea Stout was elected colonel; Theodore Turley, lieutenant-colonel; Jesse D. Hunter, major.</p>
<p><strong>Clayton's Return to Nauvoo.</strong></p>
<p><em>Saturday, 24.--</em>As my favorite horse, Joe Duncan, was somewhat jaded, with being ridden so hastily by Brother Clayton, I hired a man with his horse and buggy to carry Brother Clayton to Rock Island, where the steamerÂ <em>Amaranth</em>fortunately came in about fifteen minutes, on which he took passage to Nauvoo, to inform my brother Hyrum of what was being done, and request him to send me some assistance forthwith.</p>
<p><a name="443 - 444" id="443 - 444"></a>About eight, the Master-in-Chancery arrived and issued a writ of habeas corpus returnable before the Hon. John D. Caton, Judge of the 9th Judicial Circuit at Ottawa, which was duly served on Reynolds and Wilson.</p>
<p><a name="444" id="444"></a>[Page 444]</p>
<p><strong>Cyrus Walker's Terms for Legal Service.</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Cyrus Walker, who was out electioneering to become the representative for Congress, told me that he could not find time to be my lawyer unless I could promise him my vote. He being considered the greatest criminal lawyer in that part of Illinois, I determined to secure his aid, and promised him my vote. He afterwards went to Markham and joyfully said, "I am now sure of my election, as Joseph Smith has promised me his vote, and I am going to defend him."</p>
<p><strong>Turning the Tables on Reynolds and Wilson.</strong></p>
<p>At ten a.m. another writ was issued--this time from the Circuit Court of Lee county, against Reynolds and Wilson. for private damage and for false imprisonment, claiming ten thousand dollars damages upon the ground that the writ issued by the governor of Illinois was a void writ in law; upon which said writ they were held to bail in ten thousand dollars each, and they had to send to Missouri for bondsmen and were placed in the custody of the sheriff of Lee county.</p>
<p>Reynolds and Wilson felt bad when these last writs were served on them, and began to cool in their conduct a little; after which they also obtained a writ of habeas corpus, for the purpose of being discharged before Judge Caton.</p>
<p><strong>Arrival at Pawpaw Grove.</strong></p>
<p>I was conveyed by Reynolds and Wilson, upon the first writ of habeas corpus, towards Ottawa, as far as Pawpaw Grove, thirty-two miles, where I was again abused by Reynolds and Wilson, which was observed by the landlord.</p>
<p>Esquire Walker sent Mr. Campbell, sheriff of Lee county, to my assistance, and he came and slept by me. In the morning certain men wished to see me, but I was not allowed to see them.</p>
<p><a name="444 - 445" id="444 - 445"></a>The news of my arrival had hastily circulated about the neighborhood; and very early in the morning the largest room in the hotel was filled with citizens, who were anxious to hear me preach and requested me to address them.</p>
<p><a name="445" id="445"></a>[Page 445]</p>
<p>Sheriff Reynolds entered the room and said, pointing to me, "I wish you to understand this man is my prisoner, and I want you to disperse: you must not gather around here in this way." Upon which Mr. David Town, an aged gentleman, who was lame and carried a large hickory walking-stick, advanced towards Reynolds, bringing his hickory upon the floor, and said:</p>
<p><strong>David Town's Effective Speech.</strong></p>
<p>"You damned infernal puke, we'll learn you to come here and interrupt gentlemen. Sit down there, (pointing to a very low chair,) and sit still. Don't open your head till General Smith gets through talking. If you never learned manners in Missouri, we'll teach you that gentlemen are not to be imposed upon by a nigger-driver. You cannot kidnap men here, if you do in Missouri; and if you attempt it here, there's a committee in this grove that will sit on your case; and, sir, it is the highest tribunal in the United States, asÂ <em>from its decision there is no appeal."</em></p>
<p>Reynolds, no doubt aware that the person addressing him was the head of a committee who had prevented the settlers on the public domain from being imposed upon by land speculators, sat down in silence while I addressed the assembly for an hour-and-a-half on the subject of marriage, my visitors having requested me to give them my views of the laws of God respecting marriage. My freedom commenced from that hour.</p>
<p><strong>Departure of Emma Smith from Dixon.</strong></p>
<p>Immediately after I left Dixon, my wife and children started with my carriage from Inlet Grove for Nauvoo being driven by her nephew, Lorenzo D. Wasson.</p>
<p>The quorum of the Twelve received a letter from Asahel Smith, [the prophet's father's brother, and father of the late Judge Elias Smith] of Nashville, Iowa, requesting them to appoint a conference in that place to settle some difficulties existing there.</p>
<p><a name="446" id="446"></a>[Page 446]</p>
<p><strong>A Masonic Temple for Nauvoo.</strong></p>
<p>The free and accepted ancient York Masons met at the lodge room, being the anniversary of St. John's Day; then formed a procession in due masonic form In front of the hall, and walked to Main street, where the corner stone for a Masonic Temple was laid by the Worshipful Master, Hyrum Smith. Two masonic hymns were sung, after which they proceeded to the Grove near the Temple, where an oration was delivered by Brother John Taylor. From thence they proceeded to Mr. Warner's, where about two hundred sat down to an excellent dinner. The company broke up early in the afternoon, highly delighted with the day's proceedings.</p>
<p><em>Sunday, 25.--</em>At Pawpaw Grove it was ascertained that Judge Caton was on a visit to New York, whereupon Reynolds, Wilson, Walker, Southwick, Patrick, Dixon, Stephen Markham and myself, with others, started about eight a.m., and returned to the town of Dixon, arriving about four p.m. when, I was again locked in a room and guarded through the night.</p>
<p>The water has fallen in the Mississippi more than a foot since last Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>Excitement at Nauvoo.</strong></p>
<p>At ten a.m., meeting at the Temple. Elder Lyman Wight preached on charity; and in the afternoon, Elder Maginn was preaching, when my brother Hyrum went to the stand and requested the brethren to meet him at the Masonic Hall in thirty minutes.</p>
<p><a name="446 - 447" id="446 - 447"></a>The brethren immediately went there in such numbers that one fourth of them could not get into the room; so they adjourned to the green and formed a hollow square, when my brother Hyrum informed them that Elder William Clayton had arrived about two, and told him that Joseph H. Reynolds, sheriff of Jackson county, Missouri, and Harmon T. Wilson, of Carthage, had come upon me by surprise and arrested me, and related the occurrence as far as known, up to my arrival in Dixon. He wanted a company to go up to my assistance and see that I had my rights. He called for volunteers, when upwards of three hundred volunteered, from whom they selected such as were wanted.</p>
<p><a name="447" id="447"></a>[Page 447]</p>
<p><strong>Relief Expeditions.</strong></p>
<p>Generals Law and Charles C. Rich started the same evening, with a company of about one hundred and seventy-five men on horseback. Previous to starting, Elder Wilford Woodruff went to the company and donated a barrel of rifle powder, when every man filled his horn or flask.</p>
<p>Wilson Law declared he would not go a step unless he could have money to bear his expenses, upon which Elder Brigham Young said the money should be forthcoming although he did not know at the time where he could raise a dollar. In about thirty minutes he got on the track, and in the course of two hours he had borrowed seven hundred dollars, and put it in the hands of Hyrum Smith and Wilson Law, to defray the expenses of the expedition. About seventy-five on board the<em>Â Maid of Iowa,Â </em>with Captain Dan Jones, went up the Illinois river for Peoria, and to examine the steamboats, suspecting I might be a prisoner on board one of them, as they supposed me on the road to Ottawa.</p>
<p>Several of the Pottawatamie Indians called to see the Nauvoo House and Temple. They wanted to talk, but their interpreter could not speak much.</p>
<p><a name="447 - 448" id="447 - 448"></a><strong>Writ of Habeas Corpus Secured.</strong></p>
<p><a name="447 - 448" id="447 - 448"></a>The writ of habeas corpus [the one first issued and made returnable before Judge Caton at Ottawa] was returned endorsed thereon, "Judge absent," when another writ of habeas corpus was issued at seven a.m. by the Master-in-Chancery, and was worded at Colonel Markham's request, "Returnable before the nearest tribunal in the Fifth Judicial District authorized to hear and determine writs of habeas corpus;" and the sheriff of Lee county served it on them [Reynolds and Wilson] in a few minutes afterwards. I, my lawyers, Markham, Dixon and other friends held a council and arranged to start before nine a.m., to go before Judge Stephen A. Douglas, at Quincy, a distance of about two hundred and sixty miles. I employed Mr. Lucien P. Sanger with the stage coach to convey us on our journey towards Quincy.</p>
<p><a name="448" id="448"></a>[Page 448]</p>
<p>After these arrangements were made, I sent Markham with a letter to General Wilson Law, directing him to meet me at Monmouth on Wednesday evening, with sufficient force to prevent my being kidnapped into Missouri, as I well knew that the whole country was swarming with men anxious to carry me there and kill me, without any shadow of law or justice, although they well knew that I had not committed any crime worthy of death or bonds.</p>
<p><em>Monday, 26.--</em>It was reported that there were state writs in Nauvoo to take Lyman Wight, Parley P. Pratt, and Alexander McRae to Missouri, who armed themselves to prevent being kidnapped.</p>
<p>I copy the following from theÂ <em>Chicago Democrat:</em></p>
<p>Account of the Prophet's Arrest in the Chicago Democrat.</p>
<p>Dear Sir:--Our little town has been in an unusual state of excitement for a few days past, originating from the arrest of General Joseph Smith, which took place at the Inlet Grove, while he was on a visit with his family to a sister [an error, his wife's nephew] who resides there. He was arrested on Friday last by an officer from Hancock county, and delivered over to the sheriff of Jackson county, Missouri, in compliance with the orders of the governor.</p>
<p>The officers who took him brought him into town in the evening and confined him closely to his room, refusing admission not only to the citizens whose curiosity had drawn them to the spot, but to counsel whom he had requested to have employed.</p>
<p>Our citizens, conceiving it a violation of right that a man should be deprived of that advice and assistance which is accorded to the most degraded and guilty offender in all civilized countries under such circumstances, expressed themselves in such strong and indignant terms, that the officers finally permitted counsel to have access to him.</p>
<p>He applied for the benefit of the habeas corpus; and while the lawyers were busy drawing up the necessary papers, the officers frequently asserted that they would not wait, but would leave for the Mississippi at all hazards.</p>
<p><a name="449" id="449"></a>[Page 449]</p>
<p>They were however, induced, by the force of argument, to desist from their intention and wait until morning, when the habeas corpus was served. After which they stated their determination to go to Rock Island and by steamboat from thence to Galena, before Judge Brown. General Smith justly felt fearful that once on a steamboat, he should hardly reach Galena. The distance from this place to Rock Island is the same as from here to Galena.</p>
<p>General Smith, finding this their determination, commenced suit against the sheriff of Missouri for trespass, and held him to bail, which he was unable to procure, which circumstance lowered his tune a little; and thus finally, today, has left for Quincy in search of Judge Young.</p>
<p>The severe treatment of the general, together with his pleasing deportment and equanimity under all his trials, has made him many friends and created almost universal sympathy. Persecution or oppression always helps the cause of the persecuted or oppressed, whether their cause is right or wrong.Â <br />
In haste, yours,</p>
<p>G.</p>
<p>From Dixon we traveled about forty miles, and stayed for the night at a farm house. Markham rode to Genesseo with my letter and stayed all night.</p>
<p><strong>En route for Quincy.</strong></p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 27.--</em>I started with the company, and took dinner at Genesseo. At about two p.m., we resumed our journey. While crossing Fox River, I requested Reynolds to give me the privilege of riding on horseback, which he refused; but, by the intercession of Sheriff Campbell and Mr. Cyrus Walker, Walker took my seat in the stage-coach, and I his in the buggy with Mr. Montgomery, son-in-law and law student of Cyrus Walker. In about two miles we met Peter W. Conover and William L. Cutler, and shook hands with both of them at the same time, and could not refrain from tears at seeing the first of my friends come to meet me, and then said to Mr. Montgomery, "I am not going to Missouri this time. These are my boys."</p>
<p>I next enquired how many were with them, and was answered, there were ten started, but they had sent one with my letter to Wilson Law, and two to Monmouth.</p>
<p><a name="450" id="450"></a>[Page 450]</p>
<p>While we were talking, Markham, with Captain Thomas Grover, and the other five brethren, rode up. At the same time, the company who started with me from Dixon rode up. I then said to Reynolds, "Now, Reynolds, I can have the privilege of riding old Joe Duncan," and mounted my favorite horse and the entire company then rode towards a farm house, where we made a halt.</p>
<p>Reynolds and Wilson, who trembled much, then rode up to Conover, who was an old acquaintance of Wilson's; when Conover asked Wilson, "What is the matter with you? Have you got the ague?" Wilson replied, "No."</p>
<p>Reynolds asked, "Is Jem Flack in the crowd?" and was answered, "He is not now, but you will see him tomorrow about this time." "Then," said Reynolds, "I am a dead man; for I know him of old." Conover told him not to be frightened, for he would not be hurt.</p>
<p>Reynolds stood trembling like an aspen-leaf, when Markham walked up to him and shook hands with him. Reynolds said, "Do I meet you as a friend? I expected to be a dead man when I met you again." Markham replied, "We are friends, except in law: That must have its course."</p>
<p>The company moved on to Andover, where the sheriff of Lee county requested lodgings for the night for all the company. I was put up into a room and locked up with Captain Grover. It was reported to me that some of the brethren had been drinking whisky that day in violation of the Word of Wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>Conover's Account of the First Division of the Expedition to Relieve the Prophet.</strong></p>
<p>I called the brethren in and investigated the case, and was satisfied that no evil had been done. Peter W. Conover gave me the following relation of the travels of the brethren from Nauvoo to the place where I met them:--</p>
<p><a name="450 - 451" id="450 - 451"></a>I started with General Wilson Law, William Law, and about 175 men, on Sunday, the 25th of June, at eight p.m., in the direction of Peoria: traveled part of the night. About one o'clock next morning General Charles C. Rich took 35 of the company and continued towards Peoria. The two Laws, with their company, started up the river road in the direction of Monmouth. We traveled till daylight on Monday morning, crossed Honey Creek, ate a cold breakfast, and fed the horses; then continued on till noon, when a consultation was held, and ten of the best mounted men--<em>viz.</em>, Thomas Grover, Peter W. Conover, Zebedee Coltrin, Graham Coltrin, Philemon C. Merrill, Philander Colton, Henry Hoyt, William L. Cutler, Daniel F. Cahoon, and John L. Butler were selected to take the nearest road to Dixon, with instructions to continue until we found you.</p>
<p><a name="451" id="451"></a>[Page 451]</p>
<p>We took the middle road between Oquaka and Monmouth, and continued on until Tuesday at two a.m., when we rested for one hour, then passed through Hendersonville on to the prairie, about nine a.m., at which time we met Colonel Stephen Markham with your letter of instructions to General Wilson Law. We read the letter. Philander Colton was sent with the despatch to Wilson Law. We then made a halt at Andover, where the inhabitants refused to sell us food.</p>
<p>Here we held a council, and sent Daniel Cahoon and Henry Hoyt back to Monmouth, with instructions to the brethren to wait there until they got further orders. We then traveled ten miles and obtained some corn at a farm-house. One p.m., left there and traveled on to the prairies until we met you.</p>
<p>Here Conover exchanged with me one of Allen's four-inch barrel six-shooter revolvers for the single shooter which Markham had slipped into my pocket at Dixon.</p>
<p><strong>Reynolds and Wilson's Design of Kidnapping.</strong></p>
<p>About eight p.m., Reynolds, Wilson, and the landlord consulted about sending out to raise a company to take me by force, and run with me to the mouth of Rock River on the Mississippi, as there was a company of men ready to kidnap me over the river. Markham overheard the conversation, and notified the sheriff of Lee county, who immediately ordered a guard placed, so that no one might pass in or out of the house during the night.</p>
<p><a name="451 - 452" id="451 - 452"></a>Markham started at daybreak, and went about twenty miles, passing through Andover at eight a.m.; and about nine he met Captain Thomas Grover and a company of ten men, to whom he delivered my message. Held a council and forwarded it on to General Law by Philander Colton. Markham turned back with the company.</p>
<p><a name="452" id="452"></a>[Page 452]</p>
<p>My wife and children arrived in Nauvoo this evening, having burned off one arm of the carriage going home.</p>
<p>Many strangers reported in the city: the watch was doubled in the night.</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 28.--</em>We left Andover about eight o'clock; went to a little grove at the head of Elleston Creek, where we stayed an hour to feed our animals. Reynolds said, "Now, we will go from here to the mouth of Rock River and take steamboat to Quincy." Markham said, "No; for we are prepared to travel, and will go by land."</p>
<p><strong>Reynolds and Wilson Disarmed.</strong></p>
<p>Wilson and Reynolds both spoke and said, "No, by G--, we won't; we will never go by Nauvoo alive;" and both drew their pistols on Markham, who turned round to Sheriff Campbell, of Lee county, saying, "When these men took Joseph a prisoner, they took his arms from him, even to his pocket-knife. They are now prisoners of yours, and I demand of you to take their arms from them, that is according to law."</p>
<p>They refused to give them up, when the sheriff was told, "If you cannot take the arms from them, there are men enough here, and you can summon a posse to do it; for it is plain to be seen that they are dangerous men."</p>
<p>Reynolds and Wilson then reluctantly gave up their arms to the sheriff. The company then started, taking the middle road towards Nauvoo to within six miles of Monmouth, and stopped at a farmhouse, having traveled about forty miles; got there about sundown, and called for supper and lodging.</p>
<p><a name="452 - 453" id="452 - 453"></a><strong>Further Plans of Kidnapping.</strong></p>
<p><a name="452 - 453" id="452 - 453"></a>Peter W. Conover laid down at the S.W. corner of the building outside the house. In about ten minutes, Reynolds and Wilson came out of the house with the son of the landlord. They talked for some time, and came to the conclusion to take the carriage horses, go to Monmouth, raise a mob, and come to the farmhouse in the night, seize Joseph, and convey him to the Mississippi River and take him to Missouri, as they had a steamboat in readiness at the mouth of Rock River for that purpose.</p>
<p><a name="453" id="453"></a>[Page 453]</p>
<p>After completing their plan of operations, Reynolds, Wilson and the boy separated and went towards the stable. Conover, who had heard the plot unobserved, immediately rose and came to me, and told me what he had just heard.</p>
<p>I consulted with Cyrus Walker, the landlord, and Sheriff Campbell, who took Reynolds and Wilson into his custody, and put them in the upper room, placing a guard of two men at the door, with orders not to allow any man to pass in or out of the house, except the landlord, who, as soon as he was told of the attempt to get his son into difficulty, put a stop to his proceedings at once.</p>
<p>Some anxiety at Nauvoo about so many strangers and suspicious characters being in the city.</p>
<p>The<em>Â NeighborÂ </em>of this day has the following:--</p>
<p>Fourth of July Celebration Appointed for Nauvoo.</p>
<p>By the counsel and advice of President Hyrum Smith, Messrs. O. Hyde and G. J. Adams, who have been appointed to go on a mission to Russia, will deliver two addresses on the 4th July, upon the subject of our holy religion, for the benefit and edification not only of our own citizens, but also for strangers who may be pleased to visit our town on that day. The morning's address by Mr. Hyde, at half past ten o'clock; and the afternoon by Mr. Adams, at two o'clock.</p>
<p>From the circumstances under which we are placed, this course is thought far more advisable for all who wish to be considered Saints to assemble for religious worship and collectively offer up our prayers to Almighty God for peace and prosperity to attend us as a people.</p>
<p>The giddy and unthinking will, no doubt, resort to public dinners, festivals, and perhaps to the ball chamber, to spend their time and money to gratify their appetite and vanity; but no true-hearted Saint at this peculiar moment will do it.</p>
<p>At the close of each address a collection will be taken for the especial purpose of assisting to complete Elder Hyde's house, that he may he the sooner liberated to proceed on his important mission to St. Petersburg.</p>
<p><a name="454" id="454"></a>[Page 454]</p>
<p>He who has money to spend on that day can spend it more to the glory of God in the above manner than after the custom and practice of the corrupt age in which we live.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the band and choir will favor us on that occasion.</p>
<p>The lectures will be delivered in the Grove near the Temple where seats are provided.</p>
<p><strong>The Prophet Protects Reynolds Against Flack.</strong></p>
<p><em>Thursday, 29.--</em>Continued our journey this morning leaving Monmouth on our left, and Oquaka five miles on our right; and after passing Monmouth about three miles, William Empy, Gilbert Rolfe, James Flack, and three others met us.</p>
<p>I called Flack to my side and told him not to injure Reynolds, whatever provocation he had previously received from him, as I had pledged myself to protect him, and requested Flack to bury his feelings against Reynolds.</p>
<p>Reynolds then got out of the stage, exchanged seats with one of the horsemen, and Flack and Reynolds rode by themselves about a quarter-of-a-mile, when they again joined the company and rode together. The company continued to Henderson River, and took dinner at a farmhouse owned by Mr. Alanson Hagerman.</p>
<p>While staying at this farmhouse, General Wilson Law, and William Law, and about sixty men came up in several little squads. I walked out several rods to meet the company. William and Wilson Law jumped from their horses, and unitedly hugged and kissed me, when many tears of joy were shed.</p>
<p>I extract from the journal of Albert P. Rockwood, the acting adjutant of the company, some of the movements of the company:--</p>
<p><a name="454 - 455" id="454 - 455"></a>Rockwood's Account of the Second Division of the Expedition to Relieve the Prophet.</p>
<p><a name="454 - 455" id="454 - 455"></a>After breakfast at the tavern, on Thursday, 29th, had a few minutes deliberation. It was determined that those who had animals which were able to continue the pursuit, with a reasonable prospect of catching up, should follow at the full speed of their animals. Having heard that the posse had taken a westerly direction, as we believed, designing to cross the Mississippi at Oquaka Ferry, and so through Iowa to Missouri, raised an excitement, and most of us thought we were good for twelve miles an hour.</p>
<p><a name="455" id="455"></a>[Page 455]</p>
<p>Several brethren swapped their worn-out animals for fresh ones; others bought; so that, in a few minutes, about two-thirds of the detachment were in swift pursuit.</p>
<p>On arriving near the farmhouse where the posse stayed last night, we learned that they had been gone about two hours. Then General Law said, "Now, boys, comes the tug of war: every man and horse try your best;" and away we went with our blood at fighting heat.</p>
<p>By frequent enquiries we learned that we were gaining upon them. As we approached the river, we quickened our pace, which left some far in the rear.</p>
<p>At a watering-place, about three miles from the river, General Wilson Law and William Law, Elisha Everett, Albert P. Rockwood, and two others took passage in a wagon. Having fresh animals, we left most of the detachment in the rear: yet Brother Follet and from five to ten others were up with us, positively charged with fight.</p>
<p>While in the wagon, Wilson Law remarked, "We must overhaul them before they can get on the ferry-boat to cross the river, and we must take the stand that Joseph should not be taken over the river: therefore prepare yourselves for your best licks; for if Joseph goes into Missouri, they will kill him, and that will break us up, as our property in Nauvoo will become useless or of no value," etc., etc.</p>
<p>During the conversation we emerged from the timber and saw a small village on the bank of the river. We put our animals at their full speed and charged in with drawn swords, our guns and pistols cocked and primed, ready for attack.</p>
<p>Our sudden appearance and hostile movements caused much excitement in the village. General Law forced the contents of a bottle of spirits down his horse. Some of our horses fell to the ground as soon as we halted. All were foaming with sweat and nearly exhausted.</p>
<p>Some of the citizens refused to give us any information. Others declared, "I have done nothing," and expressed their fears and anxieties in various ways. I ran down to the river and down the beach, while William Law ran up, each in search of the ferry-boat, which happened to be on the other side. No tracks or other evidence could be found by us that any persons had passed the river this morning. Wilson Law was at this time making enquiries of the citizens.</p>
<p>Some of the horsemen rode on full speed through the village of Oquaka in search of the Prophet, while others left their exhausted horses standing or lying in the streets, and ran on foot.</p>
<p><a name="455 - 456" id="455 - 456"></a>As soon as William Law and myself returned to the wagon, we concluded that the posse, knowing that we were near by to rescue, had taken to the woods to secrete themselves or evade us; therefore Brother Follet and such others as they came in were ordered to search the timbers. In a short time a wayfaring man reported he had seen a company passing down the river road below the village, whereupon all hands were ordered to the pursuit, and soon the village was clear of "the destroying angels" (as they called us), and they were left to their own reflections and meditations on the strange scene. My opinion is that we were in the village from thirty to forty minutes, until we were all again on the trail.</p>
<p><a name="456" id="456"></a>[Page 456]</p>
<p>Those who were in the rear of our detachment saw the posse who had Joseph traveling down the road. They crossed the prairie and arrived nearly one hour before the advance, who missed the trail about half-a-mile from the village, at the junction of the Monmouth and River Road. On their arrival Joseph sent a messenger back to notify us where he was, who met us about a mile from the place where he was stopping.</p>
<p><strong>Change of Destination from Quincy to Nauvoo.</strong></p>
<p>I consulted with my lawyers, and told them that Nauvoo was the nearest place where writs of habeas corpus could be heard and determined. They examined the subject and decided I was correct, when we turned our steps towards Nauvoo, which gladdened my heart at the prospect of soon being in the midst of my friends again. I sent a messenger to inform the citizens of Nauvoo of the glad change; and I requested Conover to ride ahead to Mr. Michael Crane's, on Honey Creek, and call for supper for one hundred men.</p>
<p>After dinner we traveled about fifteen miles. On arriving at Crane's, I jumped out of the buggy, and instead of going through the gate or climbing the fence, walked up and jumped over the fence without touching it. Mr. Crane ran out and embraced me, and bade me welcome.</p>
<p>A flock of turkeys and chickens were killed, and a substantial supper was provided for all; and the company feasted, sang, and had a happy time that night. I showed my sides to Mr. Crane and the company, which still continued black and blue from the bruises I had received from the pistols of Reynolds and Wilson, while riding from Inlet Grove to Dixon eight days ago.</p>

<p><strong>Announcement of the Arrival of the Prophet at Nauvoo.</strong></p>
<p><em>Friday, 30.--</em>A messenger started from my company in the night, and arrived in Nauvoo early in the morning, saying that I and the company would be in the city about noon. Dr. Willard Richards and Wilford Woodruff arranged the seats in the court-room, preparatory to my arrival.</p>
<p>At half-past ten o'clock, the Nauvoo Brass Band and Martial Band started with Emma and my brother Hyrum to meet me; also a train of carriages, containing a number of the principal inhabitants.</p>
<p>At eight a.m., the company with me again started; arrived at the Big Mound about half-past ten, where the brethren decorated the bridles of their horses with the flowers of the prairie, and were met by a number of the citizens. Continued our journey; and at 11:25 a.m., I was gladdened, when opposite my brother Hyrum's farm, about one-and-a-half miles east of the Temple, with seeing the train approaching towards us; and I directed Colonel Rockwood to place my Life Guards in their appropriate position in the procession. I was in a buggy with Mr. Montgomery. Sheriff Reynolds and Wilson, with my three lawyers, Cyrus Walker, Shepherd G. Patrick, and Edward Southwick, were in the stage coach with Lucien P. Sanger, the stage proprietor. Mr. Campbell, the sheriff of Lee county, and a company of about 140 were with me on horseback.</p>
<p><a name="459" id="459"></a>[Page 459]</p>
<p>I was a prisoner in the hands of Reynolds, the agent of Missouri, and Wilson, his assistant. They were prisoners in the hands of Sheriff Campbell, who had delivered the whole of us into the hands of Colonel Markham, guarded by my friends, so that none of us could escape.</p>
<p><strong>The Entrance into Nauvoo.</strong></p>
<p>When the company from the city came up, I said I thought I would now ride a little easier; got out of the buggy; and, after embracing Emma and my brother Hyrum, who wept tears of joy at my return, as did also most of the great company who surrounded us, (it was a solemn, silent meeting,) I mounted my favorite horse, "Old Charley," when the band struck up "Hail Columbia," and proceeded to march slowly towards the city, Emma riding by my side into town.</p>
<p>The carriages having formed in line, the company with me followed next, and the citizens fell in the rear. As we approached the city, the scene continued to grow more interesting; the streets were generally lined on both sides with the brethren and sisters, whose countenances were joyous and full of satisfaction to see me once more safe.</p>
<p>I was greeted with the cheers of the people and firing of guns and cannon. We were obliged to appoint a number of men to keep the streets open for the procession to pass, and arrived at my house about one o'clock, where my aged mother was at the door to embrace me, with tears of joy rolling down her cheeks, and my children clung around me with feelings of enthusiastic and enraptured pleasure. Little Fred, exclaimed, "Pa, the Missourians won't take you away again, will they?" The friends from Dixon gazed with astonishment and rapture to see the enthusiastic attachment of my family and the Saints towards me.</p>
<p><a name="459 - 460" id="459 - 460"></a>The multitude seemed unwilling to disperse until after I had arisen on the fence and told them, "I am out of the hands of the Missourians again, thank God. I thank you all for your kindness and love to me. I bless you all in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. I shall address you at the Grove, near the Temple, at four o'clock this afternoon."</p>
<p><a name="459 - 460" id="459 - 460"></a>When I went to dinner with my family, Reynolds and Wilson were placed at the head of the table, with about 50 of my friends, and were served with the best that the table afforded, by my wife, whom they refused to allow me to see, when they so cruelly arrested and ill-treated me, which contrasted strongly with their treatment to me when I was first arrested by them, and until my friends met me.</p>
