<p>Prophet's Retirement from Editorship of "Times and Seasons"--Progress of Work on the Temple--Division of Nauvoo into Ten Wards--Wm. Smith in the Illinois Legislature--Governor Ford on Missouri's Demand for the Prophet.</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, November 15, 1842.</em>--About home. Wrote for the <em>Times and Seasons</em> the following:</p>
<p>Valedictory.</p>
<p>I beg leave to inform the subscribers of the <em>Times and Seasons</em> that it is impossible for me to fulfill the arduous duties of the editorial department any longer. The multiplicity off other business that daily devolves upon me renders it impossible for me to do justice to a paper so widely circulated as the <em>Times and Seasons.</em> I have appointed Elder John Taylor, who is less encumbered and fully competent to assume the responsibilities of that office, and I doubt not that he will give satisfaction to the patrons of the paper. As this number commences a new volume, it also commences his editorial career.</p>
<p>Joseph Smith.</p>
<p>Elder Taylor proceeded to his duties as editor.</p>
<p>Elder Bradley Wilson died suddenly in his 74th year. He received the gospel in Ohio, removed his family to Missouri, and was driven to Nauvoo in 1839. He has left seven sons and thirty-nine grand-children residing in Nauvoo.</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 16</em>--About home. In the evening started on a journey to the counties north, in company with John D. Parker.</p>
<p><em>Thursday, 17.</em>--There was a severe snow storm, and Elder Alpheus Harmon (who was just returning from a mission), and another man, were frozen to death on the prairie between Nauvoo and Carthage. The Mississippi was frozen over, which fulfilled my prophecy of the 5th instant.</p>

<p><strong>Vote to Suspend the <em>Millenial Star.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Monday, 21.</em>--A Council of the Twelve, namely, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Wilford Woodruff, John Taylor, George A. Smith, Amasa Lyman, and Willard Richards, assembled at the house of Elder Heber C. Kimball, in Nauvoo, and decided by unanimous acclamation that the printing of the <em>Millennial Star</em> and all other publications in England relating to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints be suspended, on the return of Elder Parley P. Pratt from that country, until further instruction from the quorum; and that the foregoing minutes be forwarded to Elder Pratt or to the editor of the <em>Star,</em> which was done by letter from the president and clerk of the council.</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 22.</em>--I arrived at home, after a pleasant outing, in good health and spirits.</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 23.</em>--At home all day.</p>
<p><strong>Disaster on the Island of Madeira.</strong></p>
<p><em>Thursday, 24.</em>--By report of the papers, the island of Madeira was visited by a dreadful storm. The summer was hot and weather fine till the 15th, when the rain commenced falling heavily and continued to the 24th. At one o'clock in the afternoon the water fell in torrents, the sky became dark, the streets in the capital became inundated, and the affrighted inhabitants in town and country fled to the mountains. Upwards of two hundred houses were destroyed at Funchal, and much corn and wine. The damage to lives, houses, and crops on the island, and boats in the harbors was incalculable.</p>
<p><em>Saturday, 26.</em>--At home in the morning. At ten, met in city council, which resolved that the inscription for the seal to be procured for the municipal court of this city shall consist of a circle, including the words "Municipal Court, City of Nauvoo," within which is to be a book circled with rays, on which is to be inscribed the words "Constitution and Charter."</p>
<p>Wrote as follow:--</p>
<p>Letter of the Prophet to H.R. Hotchkiss--Land Purchase Contract Considered.</p>
<p>Nauvoo, November 26, 1842.</p>
<p><em>Horace R. Hotchkiss, Esq.</em></p>
<p>Dear Sir:--Yours of the 8th instant to Sidney Rigdon has been received; and, in consequence of his not knowing anything concerning the matters therein mentioned, or being in any way connected or interested in my affairs, he of course, has handed the letter to me, which I shall proceed to answer.</p>
<p>And, sir, permit me to say, on the subject of the deal between myself, as Trustee-in-Trust for the Church of Latter-day Saints, and you, that I am as anxious as ever to have the contract continue good between us, and to meet the obligations specified in the contract. I am not, neither have I ever been, wishful to shrink from it in any manner whatever, but intend to make payments as fast as my circumstances will admit.</p>
<p>But, sir, you are not unacquainted with the extreme hardness of the times and the great scarcity of money, which put it out of my power to meet all the payments as they fell due, and which has been the cause of any failure on my part; and should you feel disposed not to press the payments, but offer a lenity equivalent to the state of the times, then, sir, I shall yet endeavor to make up the payments as fast as possible, and consider the contract as still good between us.</p>
<p>I would here say that when I found it necessary to avail myself of the benefits of the bankrupt law, I knew not but that the law required of me to include you amongst the list of my creditors, notwithstanding the nature of the contract between us. This explains the reason of my doing so.</p>
<p>I have since learned, from a decision of the judge of the supreme court, that it was not necessary, and that the [bankrupt] law has no jurisdiction over such a contract. Consequently, as I have before stated, I am disposed to hold it, provided you will not press the payments. Under these circumstances, I consider it necessary to give you the information required in your letter, in regard to the number and kind of houses on the land, &amp;c.</p>
<p><a name="195" id="195"></a>[Page 195]</p>
<p>I shall expect to hear from you again soon. In regard to your having written to me some few weeks ago, I will observe that I have received no communication from you for some months back. If you wrote to me, the letter has been broken open and detained, no doubt, as has been the case with a great number of letters from my friends of late, and especially within the last three months.</p>
<p>Few if any letters for me can get through the post office in this place, and more particularly letters containing money, and matters of rough importance. I am satisfied that Sidney Rigdon and others connected with him have been the means of doing incalculable injury, not only to myself, but to the citizens in general; and, sir, under such a state of things, you will have some idea of the difficulties I have to encounter, and the censure I have to bear through the unjust conduct of that man and others, whom he permits to interfere with the post office business. Having said so much, I must close for the present.</p>
<p><a name="196" id="196"></a>[Page 196]</p>
<p>You will hereby understand my feelings upon the subject and the reasons of the course I have hitherto pursued.</p>
<p>With sentiments of due respect, I remain, as ever, yours respectfully,</p>
<p>Joseph Smith.</p>
<p>P.S.--Should it suit you better, I am ready on my part to renew the contract, and would prefer it.</p>

<p><strong>Sudden Illness of Brigham Young. </strong></p>
<p>In the evening went to see Brigham Young, in company with Dr. Richards. He was suddenly and severely attacked by disease, with strong symptoms of apoplexy. We immediately administered to him by laying on of hands and prayer, accompanied with the use of herbs. Profuse vomiting and purging followed, which were favorable indications. Although few so violently attacked ever survive long, yet the brethren were united in faith, and we had firm hopes of his recovery.</p>
<p><em>Sunday, 27.</em>--At home, except visiting President Young, who remained extremely sick.</p>
<p><strong>Temple Structure Difficulties.</strong></p>
<p><em>Monday, 28.</em>--At home all day. Charges of an unequal distribution of provisions, giving more iron and steel tools to Reynolds Cahoon's sons than to others, giving short measure of wood to Father Huntington, also letting the first course of stone around the Temple to the man who would do it for the least price, &amp;c., having been instituted by the stonecutters against the Temple committee,--<em>viz.,</em> Cahoon and Higbee, I requested the parties to appear at my house this day to have the difficulties settled by an investigation before myself and Counselor William Law. President Hyrum Smith acted as counsel for the defendants, and Elder Henry G. Sherwood for the accusers. The hearing of testimony lasted until four o'clock, at which time the meeting adjourned for half an hour. On coming together again, President Hyrum addressed the brethren at some length, showing the important responsibility of the committee, also the many difficulties they had to contend with. He advised the brethren to have charity one with another, and be united, &amp;c., &amp;c. Elder Sherwood replied to President Hyrum's remarks. President Hyrum explained some remarks before made. Elder William Law made a few pointed remarks, after which I gave my decision, which was that the committee stand in their place as before. I likewise showed the brethren that I was responsible to the state for a faithful performance of my office as sole trustee-in-trust, &amp;c., and the Temple Committee were responsible to me and had given bonds to me, to the amount of $12,000, for a faithful discharge of all duties devolving upon them as a committee, &amp;c. The trial did not conclude until about nine o'clock in the evening.</p>
<p><a name="197" id="197"></a>[Page 197]</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 29.</em>--In council with Brother Hyrum, Willard Richards, and others, concerning bankruptcy. Afternoon, attended court at the house of Mr. Hunter, grocer, before Alderman Spencer, for slander. I forgave Hunter the judgment, but he was fined $10 for contempt of court.</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 30.</em>--Morning, in counsel in the large assembly room preparing evidence in the case of bankruptcy. Afternoon, had Amos Davis brought before the municipal court for slander; but, in consequence of the informality of the writ drawn by Squire Daniel H. Wells, I was non-suited.</p>
<p>A severe storm of snow, rain and wind is reported to have been experienced at Boston this day and evening, doing much damage to the ships and wharves.</p>
<p><em>Thursday, December 1, 1842.</em>--Emma was sick, attendance upon her occupied some of my time. Visited George A. Smith and Brigham Young, who were sick. Called at Mr. Angel's, in company with Elder Richards, to give some counsel concerning a sick sister. Called on William W. Phelps to get the historical documents, &amp;c.; after which I commenced reading and revising history.</p>

<p>Extract of a Letter from Orrin Porter Rockwell, superscribed to Newel K. Whitney, dated Philadelphia, December 1, 1842, whither he had gone to escape the hands of those who sought his life in Missouri.</p>
<p>Dear Brother Joseph Smith:--I am requested by our friend Orrin Porter [Rockwell] to drop a few lines informing you that he is in this place. His health is good, but his spirits are depressed, caused by his being unable to obtain employment of any kind. He has applied in different parts of the city and country, but all without success, as farmers can get persons to work from sunrise till dark for merely what they eat. He is most anxious to hear from you, and wishes you to see his mother and the children and write all the particulars, how matters and things are, and what the prospects are. I pity him from the bottom of my heart. His lot in life seems marked with sorrow, bitterness and care. He is a noble, generous friend. But you know his worth: any comments from me would be superfluous. He will wait in this place until he hears from you. Please write immediately, as it will be a source of great comfort to him to hear [from you].</p>
<p>If Joseph is not at home, Brother Whitney will be kind enough to write. He says every other one he has come across has been afraid of their shadows, but he watches them well. He comes to see me every day, and I keep him a close prisoner! But he does not complain of my cruelty, or being hard- hearted, but, when with me, seems resigned to whatever punishment I may see proper to inflict, but he takes it in good part. Answer this as soon as received.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>S. Armstrong,</p>
<p>for Orrin Porter [Rockwell].</p>
<p><em>Friday, 2.</em>--Sat as Mayor on trial of Amos Davis, who was fined in the sum of $25 for breach of city ordinance for selling spirits by the small quantity.

<p>The Tenth Ward is bounded on the west by Green street or the Ninth Ward, and on the east by the city boundary line.</p>
<p><em>Monday, 5.</em>--In the morning, attended in council with Brother Hyrum and others on bankruptcy, making an inventory of our property, and schedule of our liabilities, that we might be prepared to avail ourselves of the laws of the land as did others. Afternoon, had conversation with Brother Green. In the evening, attended the Masonic Lodge.</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 6.</em>--Attended the trial of an appealed case of Amos Davis before the municipal court. Judgment confirmed.</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 7.</em>--Dined with Elder Orson Hyde and family. Elder Hyde has this day returned home from his mission to Jerusalem. His presence was truly gratifying. Spent the day with Elder Hyde and drawing wood.</p>
<p><em>Thursday, 8.</em>--Spent the day at home. Received a visit from Elder Hyde and wife.</p>
<p><strong>Inagural Address of Governor Ford.</strong></p>
<p>This day, Thomas Ford, governor of Illinois, in his inaugural address to the Senate and House of Representatives, remarked that a great deal has been said about certain charters granted to the people of Nauvoo. These charters are objectionable on many accounts, but particularly on account of the powers granted. The people of the state have become aroused to the subject, and anxiously desire that these charters should be modified so as to give the inhabitants of Nauvoo no greater privileges than those enjoyed by others of our fellow citizens.</p>
<p><em>Friday, 9.</em>--I chopped wood all day. My Brother Hyrum started for Springfield to attend to his case of bankruptcy, with Benjamin Covey as witness. Willard Richards, William Clayton, Henry G. Sherwood, Peter Haws, Heber C. Kimball, Alpheus Cutler, and Reynolds Cahoon accompanied them to attend to my case, present testimony to the government that I was in Illinois at the time Boggs was shot--consequently could not have been a fugitive from the justice of Missouri, and thus procure a discharge from Governor Ford, on Governor Carlin's writ for my arrest. The weather was very cold, and the traveling tedious; yet my messengers traveled thirty-four miles, and stayed with my Brother Samuel Smith, who kept a public-house at Plymouth.</p>
<p><a name="201" id="201"></a>[Page 201]</p>
<p><strong>Agitation as to Nauvoo Charter.</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Davis, of Bond county, introduced a resolution to the house of Representatives at Springfield, concerning the charter of Nauvoo, and urged its repeal.</p>
<p>Mr. Hicks was in favor of having the state arms taken from the Mormons.</p>
<p>Mr. Owen thought they had no more than their quota.</p>
<p>[The arms referred to consisted of three cannon, six-pounders, and a few score of muskets; swords, and pistols, which were furnished by the United States to Illinois, for the supply of her militia for common defense, of which the Nauvoo Legion had received but a small portion of that to which it was entitled.]</p>
<p>My Brother, William Smith, representative of Hancock county, colleague with Mr. Owen, made the following speech in the House, in reply to Mr. Davis:--</p>
<p>Speech of William Smith, Brother of the Prophet, on the Chartered Rights of Nauvoo.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker.--I beg the privilege of making a few remarks on this subject. This, sir, seems to be a question which has excited, to a very considerable extent, the attention of members who compose this honorable body. But, Mr. Speaker, it does really appear to me that this is a question that has been gotten up quite prematurely; for I doubt not many members here have not yet had the opportunity of learning what privileges are granted in the Nauvoo City Charter.</p>
<p>The subject which the gentleman has raised is only an assumption. I doubt not that if the subject had been fairly investigated, and weighed equally in the balance by every candid individual in the community, that prejudices of this kind would not have obtained such a hold upon the public mind. In the estimation of genuine democracy, the rights of the people of Nauvoo are just as sacred as those of any other people. The people that live there should have just the same privileges extended to them as are awarded to Springfield, Chicago, Quincy, or any other city in the state.</p>
<p><a name="202" id="202"></a>[Page 202]</p>
<p>It is true, indeed, that they have labored under many embarrassments. The public mind has been heated in regard to what was supposed to be their chartered privileges. But you, Mr. Speaker, are well aware that all the corporate privileges that they enjoy have been granted to them by a previous Legislature. Upon that occasion all that was done was not considered, by any, more than an act of justice towards them. They had no greater rights or privileges given them than were already enjoyed by the citizens of Quincy or Springfield. The people had chartered privileges in both of those cities, and we have the same in Nauvoo. Our condition in that respect is not at all different from Chicago, Alton, and many other chartered cities in this state. It would be hardly worth while, Mr. Speaker, to detain either you or this honorable body by making many preliminary remarks in respect to our religion. This is a matter that cannot at all come under the purview of this legislature.</p>
<p>I do not fancy myself placed here before a body of sectarians invested, in their own estimation, with authority to enact rules for the government or regulation of any sect upon matters of religion. I do not suppose that I stand in the presence of persons disposed to take away one single religious right pertaining to the people among whom I dwell.</p>
<p>But what could legislation in regard to the matter effect? What would it prove? It would neither prove Joseph Smith to be a Christian nor that Tom Thumb came from the moon. It would prove nothing in reference to the principles of any body of religionists. But I do not feel it my prerogative to enter into a discussion of religious principles here. I know very well that the people called "Mormons" are thought to be a very strange people. I come right from among them, and you can all judge whether or not they seem to have the appearance of a strange animal of seven heads and ten horns. You can all decide for yourselves whether, from the appearance I present, I should he numbered among outcasts, or be ranked among human beings.</p>
<p>One word further as to the chartered privileges. They have, as this honorable body is well aware, assembled a population of from five to ten or fifteen thousand inhabitants. It is in consequence of the privileges granted in their Charter that they have been induced to do this. Nauvoo is not, as some may erroneously suppose--a city composed entirely of Mormons. I can inform gentlemen that Methodists, Presbyterians, Baptists, Universalians, in short, many of the different kinds of religion, and even infidels may be found there; and all these are tolerated there just as in any other community. A great many persons have gone to Nauvoo, and there invested their property. They are now engaged in the erection of buildings, which, when consummated will cost enormous sums of money. But should the Charter of that city be repealed, individuals who now consider themselves rising to wealth, in consequence of what has been done by a former legislature of this state, will be reduced to wretchedness and want. In that event property now worth three to ten thousand dollars will not be worth five hundred, or nothing in comparison to that amount.</p>
<p><a name="203" id="203"></a>[Page 203]</p>
<p>There is another point, Mr. Speaker, to which I would call your attention, and that is to the observations which have been made in regard to taking away from the city of Nauvoo the state arms. Well suppose that should be done, would that effect anything? They are now organized, and have, under existing laws drawn a certain portion of the public arms. In that wherein are they acting differently from any other citizens? They have not even that equal proportion of arms that they are entitled to by law. What would be the object in taking away the public arms from the militia of this state? It surely cannot be believed that there is any danger of the Mormons breaking out and killing the people. There is no more danger of that than there is that five, six or a dozen old women and a few boys should do the same thing. Is this state to be carried by a hue-and-cry of that kind raised by politicians? I own that it is not the design of that people even so much as to molest a hair on the head of a single individual; but that, on the contrary, it is their intention in all things to conform to the Constitution and laws of the land. If prejudices have been accumulating upon the public mind calculated to produce the expression that they are villains, such prejudices are entirely unfounded. And it is a great mistake to suppose the contrary. Those people consider themselves bound by the laws, and endeavor to obey them. Have they not, I would ask, contributed their portion towards replenishing your county and state revenues? Have they ever refused to pay their taxes? Have they not always been both ready and willing to obey both the civil and military laws of this state? Where, then, is the necessity, that this honorable body should enact a law taking away from them their chartered privileges?</p>
<p>I will not, Mr. Speaker, detain you or this honorable body much longer. I am heartily sorry that a blow has been aimed at the chartered privileges of Nauvoo. I speak in defense of my constituents upon this occasion, feeling myself bound to do so, not by any former pledges, but by principle. I believe in defending the cause of the defenseless, as has already been remarked. All that we claim is equal rights and equal provisions. I would remark, for the satisfaction of my own feelings in this matter, that I was some little interested in the event of the last election. I then was engaged in the cause of Democracy, enlisted in the campaign of canvassing my county, and in consequence of the many prejudices, that were excited against the "Mormons," as they are called, I was placed under circumstances of most unparalleled embarrassment; but still I thought it a favorable opportunity to unite the Democracy of the county.</p>
<p><a name="204" id="204"></a>[Page 204]</p>
<p>I know that considerable political capital has been made by the question of Mormonism and anti-Mormonism. Perhaps one thing that now contributes to that result is, that there are hints in the governor's message in regard to a repeal of the Nauvoo Charter. It is a circumstance within my own knowledge that, previous to the last election in Hancock county, some few individuals there made strong efforts to get our votes for the governor's election. By exertions made there, more than a thousand votes were cast for the governor by Mormon influence; and since I have been here, a gentleman of opposite politics has said to me, "Now your governor is paying you off."</p>
<p>I do not allude to this to wound the feelings of any person whatever. I do not consider that the recommendation of the governor was designed to effect the repeal of our Charter. All that we have to say is that we throw ourselves upon your mercy. As Democrats we ask for equal justice and equal rights. Give us those rights, and we are content; without them we are deprived of that which was purchased by the blood of our fathers.</p>
<p><em>Saturday, 10.</em>--In this day's paper, William Smith gave his valedictory, resigning the editorship of the <em>Wasp</em> to Elder John Taylor.</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 13.</em>--I continued to chop and haul wood, and attend to my domestic concerns. My delegation arrived at Springfield about three o'clock this afternoon, and found the question of the repeal of the Nauvoo Charter in a high state of agitation in the legislature.</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 14.</em>--My delegation at Springfield having made affidavit that I was in Illinois on the 6th of May last, and consequently could not have been concerned in the attempted assassination of ex-Governor Boggs, and also having prepared a petition to Governor Ford to revoke the writ and proclamation of Governor Carlin for my arrest, they called on Governor Ford at four in the afternoon, there were present by their selection: Dr. Richards, Brother Hyrum, Elders Sherwood and Clayton, in company with Mr. Butterfield, United States district attorney, who read his communication to Sidney Rigdon, Esq., of the 20th October, my petition to revoke and countermand Governor Carlin's writ and proclamation, and the affidavit of Lilburn W. Boggs.</p>
<p><a name="205" id="205"></a>[Page 205]</p>
<p>Governor Ford, in reply, stated that he had no doubt but that the writ of Governor Carlin was illegal; but he doubted as to his authority to interfere with the acts of his predecessor. He finally concluded that he would state the case before the judges of the supreme court at their council next day, and whatever they decided on shall be his decision. He then stated his reasons for recommending a repeal of the Charter, and said that he regretted that he had not recommended a repeal of all the charters in the state.</p>
<p><em>Thursday, 15.</em>--My delegates at Springfield continued to prosecute my discharge. On the 16th, Brother Hyrum received his discharge in case of bankruptcy; every arrangement was made with Mr. Butterfield, whereby I was equally entitled to a discharge, but was put off with a plea that he must write to the office at Washington before it could be granted.</p>
<p><em>Saturday, 17.</em>--</p>
<p>Governor Ford to Joseph Smith--on the Missouri Requisition.</p>
<p>Springfield, December 17, 1842.</p>
<p>Dear Sir:--Your petition requesting me to rescind Governor Carlin's proclamation and recall the writ issued against you has been received and duly considered. I submitted your case and all the papers relating thereto to the judges of the Supreme Court, or at least to six of them who happened to be present. They were unanimous in the opinion that the requisition from Missouri was illegal and insufficient to cause your arrest, but were equally divided as to the propriety and justice of my interference with the acts of Governor Carlin. It being, therefore, a case of great doubt as to my power, and I not wishing, even in an official station, to assume the exercise of doubtful powers, and inasmuch as you have a sure and effectual remedy in the courts, I have decided to decline interfering. I can only advise that you submit to the laws and have a judicial investigation of your rights. If it should become necessary, for this purpose, to repair to Springfield, I do not believe that there will be any disposition to use illegal violence towards you; and I would feel it my duty in your case, as in the case of any other person, to protect you with any necessary amount of force from mob violence whilst asserting your rights before the courts, going to and returning.</p>
<p><a name="206" id="206"></a>[Page 206]</p>
<p>I am most respectfully yours,</p>
<p>Thomas Ford.</p>
<p>Letter of Justin Butterfield--Opinion on Governor Ford's Action.</p>
<p>Springfield, December 17, 1842.</p>
<p>Joseph Smith, Esq.<br />
Dear Sir:--I have heard the letter read which Governor Ford has written to you, and his statements are correct in relation to the opinion of the judges of the Supreme Court. The judges were unanimously of the opinion that you would be entitled to your discharge under a habeas corpus to be issued by the Supreme Court, but felt some delicacy in advising Governor Ford to revoke the order issued by Governor Carlin. My advice is, that you come here without delay, and you do not run the least risk of not being protected while here, and of being discharged by the Supreme Court by habeas corpus. I have also the right to bring the case before the U.S. Court, now in session here; and there you are certain of obtaining your discharge. I will stand by you, and see you safely delivered from your arrest.<br />
Yours truly,</p>
<p>J. Butterfield.</p>
<p>Letter from James Adams, Advising the Prophet to Appear for Trial.</p>
<p>City Of Springfield, December 17, 1842.</p>
<p><em>General J. Smith.</em></p>
<p>My Son:--It is useless for me to detail facts that the bearer can tell. But I will say that it appears to my judgment that you had best make no delay in coming before the court at this place for a discharge under a habeas corpus.</p>
<p>I am, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>J. Adams.</p>
<p>On receiving the foregoing letters, and Dr. Richards having entered for the copyright of a map of the city of Nauvoo for Joseph Smith, in the clerk's office of the District of Illinois, the brethren left Springfield for Nauvoo.</p>
<p><a name="207" id="207"></a>[Page 207]</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 20.</em>--Chopping and drawing wood with my own hands and team, as I had done mostly since the 9th. President Young continued very sick. This afternoon the brethren arrived from Springfield and presented me with Messrs. Ford, Butterfield and Adams' letters, and general history of their proceedings, which was highly satisfactory.</p>
<p><strong>The First Elder to Die in a Foreign Land.</strong></p>
<p>Elder Lorenzo D. Barnes died this morning at a quarter past three o'clock, at Bradford, England. He is the first Elder who has fallen in a foreign land in these last days. He had been long connected with the Church, and had been distinguished, both in his native land and in Great Britain, for his piety, and virtue. Read correspondence between Dr. Richards and General James Arlington Bennett, and read German with Elder Orson Hyde. Brother Shearer inquired the meaning of the "little leaven which a woman hid in three measures of meal." I replied, it alluded expressly to the last days, when there should be but little faith on the earth, and it should leaven the whole world; also there shall be safety in Zion and Jerusalem, and in the remnants whom the Lord our God shall call. The three measures refer directly to the Priesthood, truth springing up on a fixed principle, to the three in the Grand Presidency, confining the oracles to a certain head on the principle of three.</p>
<p><em>Friday, 23.</em>--Wrote R. M. Young, Esq., U.S. Senator from Illinois, Washington City, that I would accept the proposals of John C. Walsh, and give him $2,500 for the north-west quarter of section 8, 6 north, 8 west, said land lying between my farm and the city.</p>
<p><em>Saturday, 24.</em>--At home afternoon. Read and revised my history with Secretary Richards, and walked with him to see Sister Lyon, who was sick. Her babe died a few minutes before our arrival. From there we went to Brother Sabine's to compute expense money for our journey to Springfield, having just borrowed $100 for that purpose. While there, Brother Richards asked if I wanted a wicked man to pray for me? I replied, Yes; if the fervent, affectionate prayer of the righteous man availeth much, a wicked man may avail a little when praying for a righteous man. There is none good but one. The better a man is, the more his prayer will avail. Like the publican and the Pharisee, one was justified rather than the other, showing that both were justified in a degree. The prayer of a wicked man may do a righteous man good, when it does the one who prays no good.</p>
