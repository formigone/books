<p class="ChapNo">Chapter 26</p>
<p class="Chapter">The Prophet's Ministry In The Vicinity Of Commerce--Address To The Twelve.</p>
<p><em>Friday, 28.</em>--I was transacting business of various kinds; counseling, consulting the brethren, etc., etc.</p>
<p><em>Saturday 29.</em>--I was mostly at home.</p>
<p><b>The Prophet Testifies to the Book of Mormon.</b></p>
<p><em>Sunday 30.</em>--I attended meeting at Brother Bosier's. There was a crowded audience, and I bore testimony concerning the truth of the work and also of the truth of the Book of Mormon.</p>
<p>This day Sister Morris Phelps, who had traveled one hundred and fifty miles, in company with her brother, John W. Clark, to see her husband, arrived at Columbia jail.</p>
<p><b>The Missouri Prisoners.</b></p>
<p><em>Monday, July 1, 1839.</em>--I spent the day principally in counseling the brethren.</p>
<p>This day also the court was called for the trial of Parley P. Pratt, and brethren in prison in Boone county; but as they were not ready for trial, (all their witnesses had been banished the state), the court was adjourned to the 23rd of September.</p>
<p><b>Founding of Zarahemla.</b></p>
<p><em>Tuesday 2.</em>--Spent the forenoon of this day on the Iowa side of the river. Went, in company with Elders Sidney Rigdon, Hyrum Smith, and Bishops Whitney and Knight, and others, to visit a purchase lately made by Bishop Knight as a location for a town, and advised that a town be built there, and called Zarahemla.</p>
<p><b>The Prophet with the Twelve and the Seventies.</b></p>
<p>In the afternoon met with the Twelve and some of the Seventies who are about to proceed on their mission to Europe, and the nations of the earth, and islands of the sea.</p>
<p class="PageNo"><a name="383" id="383"></a>[Page 383]</p>
<p>The meeting was opened by singing and prayer, after which the Presidency proceeded to bless two of the Twelve who had lately been ordained into the quorum, namely, Wilford Woodruff and George A. Smith; and one of the Seventies, namely, Theodore Turley; after which, blessings were also pronounced by them [the Presidency] on the heads of the wives of some of those about to go abroad.</p>
<p><b>Hyrum Smith's Admonition to the Twelve.</b></p>
<p>The meeting was then addressed by President Hyrum Smith, by way of advice to the Twelve, chiefly concerning the nature of their mission; their practicing prudence and humility in their plans or subjects for preaching; necessity of their not trifling with their office, and of holding on strictly to the importance of their mission, and the authority of the Priesthood.</p>
<p>I then addressed them and gave much instruction calculated to guard them against self-sufficiency, self-righteousness, and self-importance; touching upon many subjects of importance and value to all who wish to walk humbly before the Lord, and especially teaching them to observe charity, wisdom and fellow-feeling, with love one towards another in all things, and under all circumstances, in substance as follows:</p>
<p class="Sub1">The Prophet's Address to the Twelve.</p>
<p class="Sub1"><b>Mercy and Forgiveness.</b></p>
<p>Ever keep in exercise the principle of mercy, and be ready to forgive our brother on the first intimations of repentance, and asking forgiveness; and should we even forgive our brother, or even our enemy, before he repent or ask forgiveness, our heavenly Father would be equally as merciful unto us.</p>
<p><b>Humility and Brotherhood of the Twelve.</b></p>
<p>Again, let the Twelve and all Saints be willing to confess all their sins, and not keep back a part; and let the Twelve be humble, and not be exalted, and beware of pride, and not seek to excel one above another, but act for each other's good, and pray for one another, and honor our brother or make honorable mention of his name, and not backbite and devour our brother. Why will not man learn wisdom by precept at this late age of the world, when we have such a cloud of witnesses and examples before us, and not be obliged to learn by sad experience everything we know? Must the new ones that are chosen to fill the places of those that are fallen, of the quorum of the Twelve, begin to exalt themselves, until they exalt themselves so high that they will soon tumble over and have a great fall, and go wallowing through the mud and mire and darkness, Judas like, to the buffetings of Satan, as several of the quorum have done, or will they learn wisdom and be wise? O God! give them wisdom, and keep them humble, I pray.</p>
<p class="PageNo"><a name="384" id="384"></a>[Page 384]</p>
<p><b>Avoid Vainglory.</b></p>
<p>When the Twelve or any other witnesses stand before the congregations of the earth, and they preach in the power and demonstration of the Spirit of God, and the people are astonished and confounded at the doctrine, and say, "That man has preached a powerful discourse, a great sermon," then let that man or those men take care that they do not ascribe the glory unto themselves, but be careful that they are humble, and ascribe the praise and glory to God and the Lamb; for it is by the power of the Holy Priesthood and the Holy Ghost that they have power thus to speak. What art thou, O man, but dust? And from whom receivest thou thy power and blessings, but from God?</p>
<p><b>Be Honest, Sober, Vigilant.</b></p>
<p>Then, O ye Twelve! notice this <em>Key,</em> and be wise for Christ's sake, and your own soul's sake. Ye are not sent out to be taught, but to teach. Let every word be seasoned with grace. Be vigilant; be sober. It is a day of warning, and not of many words. Act honestly before God and man. Beware of Gentile sophistry; such as bowing and scraping unto men in whom you have no confidence. Be honest, open, and frank in all your intercourse with mankind.</p>
<p class="PageNo"><a name="385" id="385"></a>[Page 385]</p>
<p><b>Beware of Treason.</b></p>
<p>O ye Twelve! and all Saints! profit by this important <em>Key</em>--that in all your trials, troubles, temptations, afflictions, bonds, imprisonments and death, see to it, that you do not betray heaven; that you do not betray Jesus Christ; that you do not betray the brethren; that you do not betray the revelations of God, whether in the Bible, Book of Mormon, or Doctrine and Covenants, or any other that ever was or ever will be given and revealed unto man in this world or that which is to come. Yea, in all your kicking and flounderings, see to it that you do not this thing, lest innocent blood be found upon your skirts, and you go down to hell. All other sins are not to be compared to sinning against the Holy Ghost, and proving a traitor to the brethren.</p>
<p><b>The sign of Apostasy.</b></p>
<p>I will give you one of the <em>Keys</em> of the mysteries of the Kingdom. It is an eternal principle, that has existed with God from all eternity: That man who rises up to condemn others, finding fault with the Church, saying that they are out of the way, while he himself is righteous, then know assuredly, that that man is in the high road to apostasy; and if he does not repent, will apostatize, as God lives. The principle is as correct as the one that Jesus put forth in saying that he who seeketh a sign is an adulterous person; and that principle is eternal, undeviating, and firm as the pillars of heaven; for whenever you see a man seeking after a sign, you may set it down that he is an adulterous man.</p>
<p>About this time, in reply to many inquiries, I also gave an explanation of the Priesthood, and many principles connected therewith, of which the following is a brief synopsis:</p>
<p class="Sub1">The Prophet on Priesthood.</p>
<p class="Sub1"><b>Adam and the Presidency of the Priesthood.</b></p>
<p>The Priesthood was first given to Adam; he obtained the First Presidency, and held the keys of it from generation to generation. He obtained it in the Creation, before the world was formed, as in <a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/1.26-28?lang=eng#25" target="_blank">Gen. 1:26-28.</a> <a class="footnote" href="#fn-1">1</a> He had dominion given him over every living creature. He is Michael the Archangel, spoken of in the Scriptures. Then to Noah, who is Gabriel; he stands next in authority to Adam in the Priesthood; he was called of God to this office, and was the father of all living in his day, and to him was given the dominion. These men held keys first on earth, and then in heaven.</p>
<p class="PageNo"><a name="386" id="386"></a>[Page 386]</p>
<p><b>Eternity of the Priesthood.</b></p>
<p>The Priesthood is an everlasting principle, and existed with God from eternity, and will to eternity, without beginning of days or end of years. The keys have to be brought from heaven whenever the Gospel is sent. When they are revealed from heaven, it is by Adam's authority.</p>
<p><b>Adam's Place in the Order of the Worthies.</b></p>
<p>Daniel in his seventh chapter speaks of the Ancient of Days; he means the oldest man, our Father Adam, Michael, <a class="footnote" href="#fn-2">2</a> he will call his children together and hold a council with them to prepare them for the coming of the Son of Man. He (Adam) is the father of the human family, and presides over the spirits of all men, and all that have had the keys must stand before him in this grand council. This may take place before some of us leave this stage of action. The Son of Man stands before him, and there is given him glory and dominion. Adam delivers up his stewardship to Christ, that which was delivered to him as holding the keys of the universe, but retains his standing as head of the human family.</p>
<p class="PageNo"><a name="387" id="387"></a>[Page 387]</p>
<p><b>The Spirit of Man Eternal.</b></p>
<p>The spirit of man is not a created being; it existed from eternity, and will exist to eternity. Anything created cannot be eternal; and earth, water, etc., had their existence in an elementary state, from eternity. Our Savior speaks of children and says, Their angels always stand before my Father. The Father called all spirits before Him at the creation of man, and organized them. He (Adam) is the head, and was told to multiply. The keys were first given to him, and by him to others. He will have to give an account of his stewardship, and they to him.</p>
<p><b>The Nature of the Priesthood.</b></p>
<p>The Priesthood is everlasting. The Savior, Moses, and Elias, gave the keys to Peter, James, and John, on the mount, when they were transfigured before him. The Priesthood is everlasting--without beginning of days or end of years; without father, mother, etc. If there is no change of ordinances, there is no change of Priesthood. Wherever the ordinances of the Gospel are administered, there is the Priesthood.</p>
<p><b>The Restoration of the Priesthood.</b></p>
<p>How have we come at the Priesthood in the last days? It came down, down, in regular succession. Peter, James, and John had it given to them and they gave it to others. Christ is the Great High Priest; Adam next. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-3">3</a> Paul speaks of the Church coming to an innumerable company of angels--to God the Judge of all--the spirits of just men made perfect; to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant--<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/12.23?lang=eng#22" target="_blank">Heb. 12:23.</a></p>
<p class="PageNo"><a name="388" id="388"></a>[Page 388]</p>
<p><b>Adam in the Valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman.</b></p>
<p>I saw Adam in the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman. He called together his children and blessed them with a patriarchal blessing. The Lord appeared in their midst, and he (Adam) blessed them all, and foretold what should befall them to the latest generation. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-4">4</a></p>
<p><b>Labors of the Patriarchs and Moses.</b></p>
<p>This is why Adam blessed his posterity; he wanted to bring them into the presence of God. They looked for a city, etc., ["whose builder and maker is God."--<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/11.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">Heb. 11:10</a>]. Moses sought to bring the children of Israel into the presence of God, through the power of the Priesthood, but he could not. In the first ages of the world they tried to establish the same thing; and there were Eliases raised up who tried to restore these very glories, but did not obtain them; but they prophesied of a day when this glory would be revealed. Paul spoke of the dispensation of the fullness of times, when God would gather together all things in one, etc.; and those men to whom these keys have been given, will have to be there; and they without us cannot be made perfect.</p>
<p class="PageNo"><a name="389" id="389"></a>[Page 389]</p>
<p><b>Angels to Have Part in the Work.</b></p>
<p>These men are in heaven, but their children are on the earth. Their bowels yearn over us. God sends down men for this reason. "And the Son of Man shall send forth His angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all things that give offense and them that do iniquity"--(<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/13.41?lang=eng#40" target="_blank">Matt. 13:41</a>). All these authoritative characters will come down and join hand in hand in bringing about this work.</p>
<p><b>The Kingdom of Heaven.</b></p>
<p>The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed. The mustard seed is small, but bring forth a large tree, and the fowls lodge in the branches. The fowls are the angels. Thus angels come down, combine together to gather their children, and gather them. We cannot be made perfect without them, nor they without us; when these things are done, the Son of Man will descend, the Ancient of Days sit; we may come to an innumerable company of angels, have communion with and receive instructions from them. Paul told about Moses' proceedings; spoke of the children of Israel being baptized--(<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/10.1-4?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">1 Cor. 10:1-4</a>). He knew this, and that all the ordinances and blessings were in the Church. Paul had these things, and we may have the fowls of heaven lodge in the branches, etc.</p>
<p><b>Future Deliverance of the Saints.</b></p>
<p>The "Horn" made war with the Saints and overcame them, until the Ancient of Days came; judgment was given to the Saints of the Most High from the Ancient of Days; the time came that the Saints possessed the Kingdom. This not only makes us ministers here, but in eternity.</p>
<p><b>Importance of Revelation.</b></p>
<p>Salvation cannot come without revelation; it is in vain for anyone to minister without it. No man is a minister of Jesus Christ without being a Prophet. No man can be a minister of Jesus Christ except he has the testimony of Jesus; and this is the spirit of prophecy. Whenever salvation has been administered, it has been by testimony. Men of the present time testify of heaven and hell, and have never seen either; and I will say that no man knows these things without this.</p>
<p class="PageNo"><a name="390" id="390"></a>[Page 390]</p>
<p><b>A Vision and Prophecy.</b></p>
<p>Men profess to prophesy. I will prophesy that the signs of the coming of the Son of Man are already commenced. One pestilence will desolate after another. We shall soon have war and bloodshed. The moon will be turned into blood. I testify of these things, and that the coming of the Son of Man is nigh, even at your doors. If our souls and our bodies are not looking forth for the coming of the Son of Man; and after we are dead, if we are not looking forth, we shall be among those who are calling for the rocks to fall upon them.</p>
<p><b>The Mission of Elijah.</b></p>
<p>The hearts of the children of men will have to be turned to the fathers, and the fathers to the children living or dead to prepare them for the coming of the Son of Man. If Elijah did not come, the whole earth would be smitten.</p>
<p><b>Blessings for the Saints in Stakes of Zion.</b></p>
<p>There will be here and there a Stake [of Zion] for the gathering of the Saints. Some may have cried peace, but the Saints and the world will have little peace from henceforth. Let this not hinder us from going to the Stakes; for God has told us to flee, not dallying, or we shall be scattered, one here, and another there. There your children shall be blessed, and you in the midst of friends where you may be blessed. The Gospel net gathers of every kind.</p>
<p><b>Haste to Build up Zion.</b></p>
<p>I prophesy, that that man who tarries after he has an opportunity of going, will be afflicted by the devil. Wars are at hand; we must not delay; but are not required to sacrifice. We ought to have the building up of Zion as our greatest object. When wars come, we shall have to flee to Zion. The cry is to make haste. The last revelation says, Ye shall not have time to have gone over the earth, until these things come. It will come as did the cholera, war, fires, and earthquakes; one pestilence after another, until the Ancient of Days comes, then judgment will be given to the Saints.</p>
<p class="PageNo"><a name="391" id="391"></a>[Page 391]</p>
<p><b>Peace in Zion and Her Stakes.</b></p>
<p>Whatever you may hear about me or Kirtland, take no notice of it, for if it be a place of refuge, the devil will use his greatest efforts to trap the Saints. You must make yourselves acquainted with those men who like Daniel pray three times a day toward the House of the Lord. Look to the Presidency and receive instruction. Every man who is afraid, covetous, will be taken in a snare. The time is soon coming, when no man will have any peace but in Zion and her stakes.</p>
<p><b>The Prophet's Vision of Judgment.</b></p>
<p>I saw men hunting the lives of their own sons, and brother murdering brother, women killing their own daughters, and daughters seeking the lives of their mothers. I saw armies arrayed against armies. I saw blood, desolation, fires. The Son of Man has said that the mother shall be against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother. These things are at our doors. They will follow the Saints of God from city to city. Satan will rage, and the spirit of the devil is now enraged. I know not how soon these things will take place; but with a view of them, shall I cry peace? No! I will lift up my voice and testify of them. How long you will have good crops, and the famine be kept off, I do not know; when the fig tree leaves, know then that the summer is nigh at hand.</p>
<p><b>Visions.</b></p>
<p>We may look for angels and receive their ministrations, but we are to try the spirits and prove them, for it is often the case that men make a mistake in regard to these things. God has so ordained that when He has communicated, no vision is to be taken but what you see by the seeing of the eye, or what you hear by the hearing of the ear. When you see a vision, pray for the interpretation; if you get not this, shut it up; there must be certainty in this matter. An open vision will manifest that which is more important. Lying spirits are going forth in the earth. There will be great manifestations of spirits, both false and true.</p>
<p class="PageNo"><a name="392" id="392"></a>[Page 392]</p>
<p><b>Angels.</b></p>
<p>Being born again, comes by the spirit of God through ordinances. An angel of God never has wings. Some will say that they have seen a spirit; that he offered them his hand, but they did not touch it. This is a lie. First, it is contrary to the plan of God: a spirit cannot come but in glory; an angel has flesh and bones; we see not their glory. The devil may appear as an angel of light. Ask God to reveal it; if it be of the devil, he will flee from you: if of God, He will manifest Himself, or make it manifest. We may come to Jesus and ask Him; He will know all about it; if He comes to a little child, He will adapt himself to the language and capacity of a little child.</p>
<p><b>Powers of the Devil; The Gift of Tongues.</b></p>
<p>Every spirit, or vision, or singing, is not of God. The devil is an orator; he is powerful; he took our Savior on to a pinnacle of the Temple, and kept Him in the wilderness for forty days. The gift of discerning spirits will be given to the Presiding Elder. Pray for him that he may have this gift. Speak not in the gift of tongues without understanding it, or without interpretation. The devil can speak in tongues; the adversary will come with his work; he can tempt all classes; can speak in English or Dutch. Let no one speak in tongues unless he interpret, except by the consent of the one who is placed to preside; then he may discern or interpret, or another may. Let us seek for the glory of Abraham, Noah, Adam, the Apostles, who have communion with [knowledge of] these things, and then we shall be among that number when Christ comes.</p>
<p class="Sub1">Chapter 26 Notes</p>
<p class="Notes"><a class="fn" name="fn-1" id="fn-1"></a>1. "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth--<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/1.26-28?lang=eng#25" target="_blank">Gen. 1:26-28.</a></p>
<p class="Notes"><a class="fn" name="fn-2" id="fn-2"></a>2. The reader will better understand the Prophet's exposition of the 7th chapter of Daniel if those parts of it with which he deals are before him, hence the following quotation:</p>
<p>"I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of Days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened. * * * * I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of Man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of Days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed."</p>
<p>The Prophet Daniel saw an earth-power arise and make war upon the Saints and prevail against them until--</p>
<p>"The Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given to the Saints of the Most High; and the time came that the Saints possessed the kingdom. * * * * And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heavens, shall be given to the people of the Saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him."</p>
<p class="Notes"><a class="fn" name="fn-3" id="fn-3"></a>3. This is in keeping with the word of the Lord in a revelation given March, 1832, where the Lord, in speaking to the Saints, said that it was His desire--</p>
<p>"That you may come up unto the crown prepared for you, and be made rulers over many kingdoms, saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Zion, who hath established the foundations of Adam-ondi-Ahman; who hath appointed Michael [Adam] your prince, and established his feet, and set him upon high, and given unto him the keys of salvation under the counsel and direction of the Holy One, who is without beginning of days or end of life."</p>
<p>It is generally supposed that Brigham Young was the author of the doctrine which places Adam as the patriarchal head of the human race, and ascribes to him the dignity of future presidency over this earth and its inhabitants, when the work of redemption shall have been completed. Those who read the Prophet's treatise on the Priesthood in the text above will have their opinions corrected upon this subject; for clearly it is the word of the Lord through the Prophet Joseph Smith which established that docrine. The utterances of President Brigham Young but repeat and expound the doctrine which the Prophet here sets forth.</p>
<p class="Notes"><a class="fn" name="fn-4" id="fn-4"></a>4. <a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.53-57?lang=eng#52" target="_blank">D&amp;C 107:53-57.</a></p>
