<p>The following is an extract from a letter to the brethren in Kirtland, written at--</p>
<p>Far West, Missouri, July 7, 1837.</p>
<p>Monday, the 3rd of July, was a great and glorious day in Far West, more than fifteen hundred Saints assembled at this place, and at half-past eight in the morning, after prayer, singing, and an address, they proceeded to break the ground for the Lord's House. The day was beautiful; the Spirit of the Lord was with us. An excavation for this great edifice, one hundred and ten feet long by eighty feet broad was nearly finished. Tuesday, the 4th, we had a large meeting, and several of the Missourians were baptized; our meetings, held in the open prairie, were larger than they were in Kirtland, when I was there. We have more or less to bless, confirm, and baptize, every Sabbath. This same day, our school section was sold at auction, and although entirely a prairie, it brought, on a year's credit, from $3.50 to $10.20 per acre, making our first school fund five thousand and seventy dollars. Land cannot he had around town now much less than ten dollars per acre.</p>
<p>Our numbers increase daily, and notwithstanding the season has been cold and backward no one has lacked a meal or went hungry. Provisions have risen in price, but not as high as accounts say they were abroad. Public notice has been given by the mob in Daviess county, north of us, for the Mormons to leave that county by the first of August and go into Caldwell: our enemies will not slumber till Satan knows how vain is his plotting. Our town gains some, we have about one hundred buildings, eight of which are stores. If the brethren abroad are wise and will come on with means and help enter the land and populate the county and build the Lord's House, we shall soon have one of the most precious spots on the globe; God grant that it may be so. Of late we receive little news from you, and we think much of that is exaggerated.</p>
<p>As ever,</p>
<p>W. W. Phelps.</p>
<p>N. B.--Please say in your <em>Messenger and Advocate</em> "A postoffice has been established at Far West, Caldwell county, Missouri."</p>

<p>The same day (July 7th), the <em>Garrick</em> passed the banks of Newfoundland.</p>
<p><strong>The Prophet Resigns his Office in the "Safety Society."</strong></p>
<p>Some time previous to this I resigned my office in the "Kirtland Safety Society," disposed of my interest therein, and withdrew from the institution; being fully aware, after so long an experiment, that no institution of the kind, established upon just and righteous principles for a blessing not only to the Church but the whole nation, would be suffered to continue its operations in such an age of darkness, speculation and wickedness. Almost all banks throughout the country, one after the other, have suspended specie payment, and gold and silver have risen in value in direct ratio with the depreciation of paper currency. The great pressure of the money market is felt in England as well as America, and bread stuffs are everywhere high. The season has been cool, wet and backward.</p>
<p><strong>Status of Various Nations.</strong></p>
<p>Mexico, unwilling to acknowledge the independence of Texas, considers her inhabitants as rebellious subjects. Spain is divided against herself, wasting her blood and treasure in her own destruction. Portugal is rapidly exhausting her resources in princely luxuries. Poland has lost her rank among the nations to gratify the ambition of Nicholas, the Russian autocrat. The government of Buenos Ayres has declared war against Peru, and nearly all the republics of South America are mingled in the strife, while the Indians continue their depredations on the inhabitants of Florida. Trouble and distress are the grand topics of conversation amongst politicians, merchants, mechanics and demagogues; and crimes, misdemeanors, and casualties, occupy a large space in the public journals.</p>

<p><em>Sunday, July 16.</em>--Elder Hyde preached on the quarterdeck of the <em>Garrick</em> concerning the prophecies; the cabin passengers listened with attention, and were particularly affected during prayer, also a little child belonging to some of the steerage passengers, that was sick until it was considered hopeless, was healed by the power of God, President Kimball laying his hands upon it secretly.</p>
<p>On the 18th the <em>Garrick</em> entered St. George's Channel, in sight of Cape Clear.</p>
<p>On Thursday morning, July 20th, the <em>Garrick</em> anchored in the River Mersey, opposite Liverpool, and while the cable chains were yet rattling the merchant ship <em>South America,</em> which left New York at the same time with the <em>Garrick,</em> under a bet, it is said, of $10,000, as to which would be in Liverpool first, came alongside, having kept in sight daily during the voyage but never getting ahead of the <em>Garrick;</em> and in all the different stages from Kirtland to Liverpool, no vessel was permitted to go past the mission.</p>
<p><strong>The Landing.</strong></p>
<p>While the passengers were going on board a steamer Elders Kimball, Hyde, Richards, and Goodson jumped into a small boat and were rowed toward shore. When within leaping distance Elder Kimball sprang from the boat as if impelled by some superior power and alighted on the steps of the dock, followed instantly by Elders Hyde and Richards, all three of whom had not one farthing on earth at their command, while Elder Woodson, having a heavy purse of silver in his hand, waited until the vessel touched shore.</p>
<p><strong>"Truth will Prevail"; Kindness of Rev. James Fielding.</strong></p>
<p>On the brethren went to Preston, about thirty miles from Liverpool, and as they alighted from the coach a large flag was unfurled nearly over their heads, with this inscription, in letters of gold, "Truth will Prevail," it being election day for members of Parliament. King William the Fourth had recently died and Queen Victoria was about to organize her cabinet. Taking lodgings in Wilford street, some of the Elders had an interview that evening with the Rev. James Fielding, brother of Joseph Fielding, who had a chapel in that place, where all the seven brethren went to hear him preach on Sunday, 23rd. After his sermon in the morning Mr. Fielding gave notice to his congregation that there were present some ministers from America, and they would occupy his pulpit in the afternoon. This unexpected offer was unsolicited but joyfully received, and in the afternoon President Kimball gave a brief relation of the history of the Church from the commencement, followed by Elder Hyde, who bore testimony to the same; thus was the key turned and the door of salvation opened to the inhabitants of England. At the close of the meeting Mr. Fielding offered his pulpit for the evening, when Elder Goodson preached and Brother Fielding bore testimony.</p>
<p><a name="499" id="499"></a>[Page 499]</p>
<p>The same day that the Gospel was first preached in England I received the following</p>
<p>Revelation given at Kirtland, Ohio, July, 23rd, 1837. The word of the Lord unto Thomas B. Marsh, concerning the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-1">1</a></p>
<p>1. Verily thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant Thomas, I have heard thy prayers, and thine alms have come up as a memorial before me, in behalf of those thy brethren who were chosen to bear testimony of my name, and to send it abroad among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, and ordained through the instrumentality of my servants.</p>
<p>2. Verily I say unto you, there have been some few things in thine heart and with thee with which I, the Lord, was not well pleased;</p>
<p>3. Nevertheless, inasmuch as thou hast abased thyself thou shalt be exalted, therefore all thy sins are forgiven thee.</p>
<p>4. Let thy heart be of good cheer before my face, and thou shalt bear record of my name, not only unto the Gentiles but also unto the Jews; and thou shalt send forth my word unto the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>5. Contend thou therefore morning by morning, and day after day let thy warning voice go forth, and when the night cometh, let not the inhabitants of the earth slumber because of thy speech.</p>
<p>6. Let thy habitation be known in Zion, and remove not thy house. for I, the Lord, have a great work for thee to do, in publishing my name among the children of men;</p>
<p><a name="500" id="500"></a>[Page 500]</p>
<p>7. Therefore gird up thy loins for the work. Let thy feet be shod, also, for thou art chosen, and thy path lieth among the mountains, and among many nations;</p>
<p>8. And by thy word many high ones shall be brought low, and by thy word many low ones shall be exalted.</p>
<p>9. Thy voice shall be a rebuke unto the transgressor, and at thy rebuke let the tongue of the slanderer cease its perverseness.</p>
<p>10. Be thou humble, and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers.</p>
<p>11. I know thy heart, and have heard thy prayers concerning thy brethren. Be not partial toward them in love above many others; but let thy love be for them as for thyself, and let thy love abound unto all men, and unto all who love my name.</p>
<p>12. And pray for thy brethren of the Twelve. Admonish them sharply for my name's sake, and let them be admonished for all their sins, and be ye faithful before me unto my name.</p>
<p>13. And after their temptations and much tribulation, behold, I, the Lord, will feel after them, and if they harden not their hearts, and stiffen not their necks against me, they shall be converted and I will heal them.</p>
<p>14. Now, I say unto you, and what I say unto you I say unto all the Twelve, Arise and gird up your loins, take up your cross, follow me, and feed my sheep.</p>
<p>15. Exalt not yourselves; rebel not against my servant Joseph, for verily I say unto you, I am with him, and my hand shall be over him; and the keys which I have given unto him, and also to youward, shall not be taken from him till I come.</p>
<p>16. Verily I say unto you my servant Thomas, thou art the man whom I have chosen to hold the keys of my kingdom (as pertaining to the Twelve) abroad among all nations,</p>
<p>17. That thou mayest be my servant to unlock the door of the kingdom in all places where my servant Joseph, and my servant Sidney, and my servant Hyrum cannot come;</p>
<p>18. For on them have I laid the burden of all the churches for a little season;</p>
<p>19. Wherefore whithersoever they shall send you, go ye, and I will be with you; and in whatsoever place ye shall proclaim my name, an effectual door shall be opened unto you that they may receive my word;</p>
<p>20. Whosoever receiveth my word receiveth me, and whosoever receiveth me receiveth those (the First Presidency) whom I have sent, whom I have made counselors for my name's sake unto you.</p>
<p><a name="501" id="501"></a>[Page 501]</p>
<p>21. And again, I say unto you, that whomsoever ye shall send in my name, by the voice of your brethren the Twelve, duly recommended and authorized by you, shall have power to open the door of my kingdom unto any nation, whithersoever ye shall send them,</p>
<p>22. Inasmuch as they shall humble themselves before me, and abide in my word, and harken to the voice of my Spirit.</p>
<p>23. Verily, verily I say unto you, darkness covereth the earth, and gross darkness the minds of the people, and all flesh has become corrupt before my face.</p>
<p>24. Behold, vengeance cometh speedily upon the inhabitants of the earth, a day of wrath, a day of burning, a day of desolation, of weeping, of mourning, and of lamentation, and as a whirlwind it shall come upon all the face of the earth, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>25. And upon my house shall it begin, and from my house shall it go forth, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>26. First among those among you, saith the Lord, who have professed to know my name, and have not known me, and have blasphemed against me in the midst of my house, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>27. Therefore see to it that you trouble not yourselves concerning the affairs of my Church in this place, saith the Lord;</p>
<p>28. But purify your hearts before me, and then go ye into all the world, and preach my Gospel unto every creature who has not received it,</p>
<p>29. And he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth not and is not baptized, shall be damned.</p>
<p>30. For unto you (the Twelve) and those (the First Presidency) who are appointed with you, to be your counselors and your leaders, is the power of this Priesthood given, for the last days and for the last time, in the which is the dispensation of the fullness of times.</p>
<p>31. Which power you hold in connection with all those who have received a dispensation at any time from the beginning of the creation;</p>
<p>32. For verily I say unto you, the keys of the dispensation which ye have received have come down from the fathers, and last of all being sent down from heaven unto you.</p>
<p>33. Verily I say unto you, behold, how great is your calling. Cleanse your hearts and your garments, lest the blood of this generation be required at your hands.</p>
<p>34. Be faithful until I come, for I come quickly, and my reward is with me to recompense every man according as his work shall be. I am Alpha and Omega. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>Baptism of Albert P. Rockwood.</strong></p>
<p>Albert P. Rockwood, <a class="footnote" href="#fn-2">2</a> of Holliston, Massachusetts, having heard of the Saints, through Elders Young and Richards, came to Kirtland to investigate, and was baptized on the 25th of July, by President Brigham Young.</p>
<p><a name="502" id="502"></a>[Page 502]</p>
<p><strong>Progress of the British Mission.</strong></p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 26.</em>--Elder Hyde preached in the evening in Mr. Fielding's chapel, and Elder Richards bore testimony. Much feeling was manifested by the congregation, and many were convinced of the truth; but Mr. Fielding, fearing for the loss of his society, more than the displeasure of heaven, closed his doors against the brethren from that time, and opposed the work with all his power. Invitations were given to the Elders to preach in private houses in different parts of Preston, which opportunities were improved daily, after the close of the factories.</p>
<p><strong>Vexatious Law Suits at Painesville.</strong></p>
<p><em>Thursday, 27.</em>--I started from Kirtland in company with Elders Rigdon and Marsh for the purpose of visiting the Saints in Canada. Brother Rockwood on his return home, Elder Brigham Young on a mission to the eastern cities, started with us. When we arrived at Painsville we were detained all day by malicious and vexatious law suits. About sun-set I got into my carriage to return home to Kirtland; at this moment the sheriff sprang into the carriage, seized my lines, and served another writ on me, which was sworn out by a man who had a few weeks previously brought a new fashioned cooking stove to Kirtland, and prevailed on me to put it up in my kitchen, saying it would give credit to his stove, wishing to have it tested by our people; and now he thought would be a good time to get pay for it. I gave my watch to the officer for security and we all returned home.</p>
<p><strong>Second Start for Canada.</strong></p>
<p>The following day I remained at home until evening, when we set out again in Brother S. B. Stoddard's wagon to Ashtabula, a distance of thirty miles and arrived there a little after daybreak and stayed till afternoon and enjoyed ourselves very much in walking on the beach and bathing in the beautiful, clear water of the lake. At four p. m. we took a deck passage on board the steamer for Buffalo. At night we all lay down to rest on the upper deck of the boat, and for pillows some took their boots, others their valises, and had a comfortable night's repose. We arrived at Buffalo the next morning in safety. Here we separated from Brothers Brigham Young and Albert P. Rockwood, they going to the Eastern States; and myself, Brothers Sidney Rigdon and Thomas B. Marsh started for Toronto, Upper Canada.</p>

<p><strong>The British Mission--Attacked by Evil Spirits.</strong></p>
<p>About daybreak Sunday, July 30th, Elder Isaac Russell, who had been appointed to preach on the Obelisk in Preston market-place that day, and who slept in the second story of their lodgings in Wilford street, went up to the third loft where Elders Hyde and Kimball were sleeping, and called upon them to pray for him, that he might be delivered from the evil spirits that were tormenting him to such a degree that he felt he could not live long unless he obtained relief. They immediately arose and laid hands on him and prayed that the Lord would have mercy on His servant and rebuke the devil. While thus engaged Elder Kimball was struck with great force by some invisible power and fell senseless on the floor; and the first thing Elder Kimball recollected was being supported by Elders Hyde and Russell beseeching the throne of grace in his behalf. They then laid him on the bed but his agony was so great he could not endure it, and arose, fell on his knees and prayed; then he arose and sat upon the bed while the brethren distinctly saw the evil spirits, who foamed and gnashed upon them with their teeth, by legions for the space of some minutes; Elder Richards was present the latter part of the time. About ten o'clock in the morning the brethren repaired to the river Ribble, according to previous appointment, and, in the midst of a large collection of people, baptized nine individuals, one of whom was George D. Watt, the first man baptized in England in this dispensation.</p>
<p><a name="504" id="504"></a>[Page 504]</p>
<p><strong>Spread of the Work in England.</strong></p>
<p>On Monday, the 31st of July, the Elders held a council and appointed Elders Goodson and Richards a mission to Bedford, and Elders Russell and Snyder to Alton, Cumberland county, continuing in prayer until morning, August 1st, when they took their departure for their several stations.</p>
<p><strong>Affairs at Far West.</strong></p>
<p>The same day (August 1st) a general meeting of the Presidency, High Council, Bishop, and counselors and the Saints assembled at Far West. The High Council elected Thomas Grover a High Councilor in place of Jesse Hitchcock; and George Morey in place of Peter Whitmer, Jun., deceased; and Titus Billings was elected Bishop's counselor in place of John Corrill. Voted unanimously by the whole assembly that in the absence of the Presidency, Councilors, Bishop and counselors at Kirtland, the Elders in Missouri had no authority [to act as a Council for the Church], consequently their acts in that capacity during that space of time are considered null and void; and that every president of High Priests and Elders be ordained by some higher authority; and the president of any quorum having counselors may ordain them himself.</p>
<p><strong>Opening of the Work in Bedford.</strong></p>
<p>Elders Goodson and Richards arrived in Bedford on the 2nd and were joyfully received by the Rev. Timothy R. Matthews, to whom they had letters of introduction from his brother-in-law, Joseph Fielding, and were invited to preach in his chapel in the evening to his congregation.</p>
<p><strong>First Confirmation in England.</strong></p>
<p><em>Friday, 4.</em>--Elder Kimball baptized Jennetta Richards <a class="footnote" href="#fn-3">3</a> at Preston, daughter of the Rev. John Richards, of Walkerfold, Chaidgley, fifteen miles from Preston, and confirmed her at the water side. This was the first confirmation in England. Sister Richards returned home the day following, Saturday, 5th, and persuaded her father to write to Elder Kimball to come and preach in his chapel.</p>
<p><a name="505" id="505"></a>[Page 505]</p>
<p><strong>Affairs in Far West--Building the Lord's House.</strong></p>
<p>The same day, August 5th, the Presidency, High Council and all the authorities of the Church in Missouri, assembled in council at Far West, and unanimously resolved to go on moderately and build a house unto the name of the Lord in Far West, as they had means, and appointed Edward Partridge treasurer, to receive all the donations and subscriptions for the erection of the House of the Lord; Isaac Morley to be his secretary. Also voted that the committee, viz., Jacob Whitmer, Elisha H. Groves, and George M. Hinkle stand [as the building committee of the Lord's House at Far West] <a class="footnote" href="#fn-4">4</a> until President David Whitmer goes to and returns from Kirtland; also, that the building committee of the House of the Lord have no store connected with building the house, but that every firm or individual that embarks in that business have, own, and claim such property as their own private individual property and stewardship.</p>
<p><strong>Goodson's Violation of Instructions.</strong></p>
<p>The Elders at Bedford continued to lecture in the basement of Mr. Matthews' chapel from evening to evening, with the most flattering prospects until this evening, when Elder Goodson, contrary to the most positive instructions of President Kimball, and without advising with any one, read publicly the vision from the Doctrine and Covenants, which turned the current of feeling generally, and nearly closed the door in all that region. Mr. Matthews wished the meetings to be removed from his house, but continued to attend the meetings occasionally and investigated the subject to considerable extent.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Elders' Journal.</em></strong></p>
<p>In the August number of the <em>Messenger and Advocate</em> was published a prospectus for a new paper, to be published at Kirtland, Ohio, called the <em>Elders' Journal</em> of the Church of Latter-day Saints, to commence in October, edited by Joseph Smith, Jun.</p>
<p><a name="506" id="506"></a>[Page 506]</p>
<p><strong>Confirmations at Preston.</strong></p>
<p>Elders Kimball and Hyde and Brother Fielding having continued their labors in Preston, Elder Hyde preached to a great multitude in the market place Sunday, the 6th of August, opposed by one Reverend gentleman who was quickly confounded by the spirit of truth; and in the evening they met at the house of Sister Ann Dawson and confirmed between forty and fifty who had been baptized, most of whom had been members of Mr. James Fielding's church, so mightily grew the word, this being only the third Sabbath of the brethren in Preston. Mr. Fielding persecuted and called the Elders "thieves, sheep stealers," etc., acknowledging them good judges, having "stolen all the best of his flock." Sister Dawson (a widow) kindly received the Elders into her house and lodged them, which was a great blessing to the brethren, as they were quite destitute, most of the people extremely poor, and lodgings scarce; while they went from house to house as invited, to procure their daily meals.</p>
<p><strong>The Work in Walkerfold.</strong></p>
<p>Elder Kimball, having received a letter from Mr. John Richards, inviting him to preach in his chapel, repaired to Walkerfold, where he was most hospitably received, and the day following preached three times in Mr. Richards' pulpit.</p>
<p><strong>Baptisms at Bedford.</strong></p>
<p>Elders Goodson and Richards baptized five at Bedford, among whom, and the first, was Mrs. Ann Braddock, a widow, who was obliged to support her family by her industry, yet she received the Elders and lodged them.</p>
<p><strong>The Failure of Mr. Matthews.</strong></p>
<p>Timothy R. Matthews, having investigated the work, acknowledged the truth, and having previously borne testimony of the same to his church in public, and urged them to go forward, agreed with Elders Goodson and Richards to meet them on the bank of the river Ouse one hour before sunset and be baptized. The hour and the Elders arrived, but Mr. Matthews was not there, he had gone out into the country to preach.</p>
<p><a name="507" id="507"></a>[Page 507]</p>
<p>Elder Kimball preached on Monday and Wednesday evenings in Mr. Richards' chapel at Walkerfold, and on Thursday baptized six individuals. Mr. Matthews baptized himself in the river, and then went to baptizing his people, denouncing the Elders as false teachers and the doctrines of the Latter-day Saints as having come from hell, while he went to preaching the same doctrine, baptizing all, even infants, and laid on hands for confirmation.</p>
<p><strong>Charles C. Rich Made President of High Priests in Missouri.</strong></p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 15.</em>--The quorum of High Priests organized at Far West, Missouri, this day. Charles C. Rich <a class="footnote" href="#fn-5">5</a> was ordained President of the High Priests' quorum in Missouri; and Henry Green president of the Elders in Caldwell county, August 20th.</p>
<p><strong>Opening in the Fox Islands.</strong></p>
<p>The same day Elders Wilford W. Woodruff and Jonathan H. Hale landed at Vinalhaven, on North Fox Island, <a class="footnote" href="#fn-6">6</a> and commenced preaching.</p>
<p>In the August number of the <em>Messenger and Advocate</em> I published the following</p>
<p>Caution.</p>
<p>To the brethren and friends of the Church of the Latter-day Saints: I am disposed to say a word relative to the bills of the "Kirtland Safety Society Bank." I hereby warn them to beware of speculators, renegades, and gamblers, who are duping the unwary and unsuspecting, by palming upon them those bills, which are of no worth here. I discountenance and disapprove of any and all such practices. I know them to be detrimental to the best interests of society, as well as to the principles of religion.</p>

<p><strong>The Alston Branch.</strong></p>
<p>In this month Elder Isaac Russell succeeded in establishing a small branch in Alston, England.</p>
<p><strong>The Prophet's Work in Canada.</strong></p>
<p>At this time I was engaged in visiting the churches in Canada, preaching, baptizing, blessing the Saints and strengthening the branches.</p>
<p>I returned to Kirtland about the last of August and wrote the following letter, which I sent by the hand of Thomas B. Marsh:</p>
<p>Kirtland, Geauga, County, Ohio,</p>
<p>September 4, 1837.</p>
<p><em>Joseph Smith, Jun., President of the Church of Christ of the Latter-day Saints in all the world, to John Corrill and the whole Church in Zion, sendeth greeting.</em></p>
<p>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed you with many blessings in Christ, and who has delivered you many times from the hands of your enemies, and planted you many times in a heavenly or holy place. My respects and love to you all, and my blessings upon all the faithful and true hearted in the New and Everlasting Covenant. Forasmuch as I have desired for a long time to see your faces and converse with you and instruct you in those things which have been revealed to me pertaining to the kingdom of God in the last days, I now write unto you offering as an apology my being bound with cords of affliction by the workers of iniquity, and also by the labors of the Church, endeavoring in all things to do the will of God for the salvation of the Church, both in temporal as well as spiritual things.</p>
<p>Brethren, we have waded through affliction and sorrow thus far for the will of God, that language is inadequate to describe. Pray ye therefore with more earnestness for our redemption. You have undoubtedly been informed by letter and otherwise of our difficulties in Kirtland, which are now about being settled; and that you may have a knowledge of the same, I inclose you the following minutes of the committee of the whole Church in Kirtland, the authorities, etc., referring you to my brother Hyrum and Brother Thomas B. Marsh for further particulars; also that you may know how to proceed to set in order and regulate the affairs of the Church in Zion whenever they become disorganized</p>
<p><a name="509" id="509"></a>[Page 509]</p>
<p>Minutes of a Conference Assembled in Committee of the whole Church at Kirtland on Sunday, the 3rd of September, 1837.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock in the morning George W. Robinson was called upon to take minutes of the conference. Sidney Rigdon then presented Joseph Smith, Jun., to the Church to know if they still looked upon and would still receive and uphold him as the President of the whole Church, and the vote was unanimous in the affirmative.</p>
<p>President Smith then presented Sidney Rigdon and Frederick G. Williams as his counselors, and to constitute with himself the three first Presidents of the Church. Voted unanimously in the affirmative, except for Frederick G. Williams, which was not carried unanimously.</p>
<p>President Smith then introduced Oliver Cowdery, Joseph Smith, Sen., Hyrum Smith, and John Smith for assistant counselors. These last four, together with the first three, are to be considered the heads of the Church. Carried unanimously.</p>
<p>Voted, that Newel K. Whitney hold his office as Bishop and continue to act as such in Kirtland, and that Reynolds Cahoon and Vinson Knight continue to act as counselors to the Bishop.</p>
<p>The Twelve Apostles were then presented one by one, when Thomas B. Marsh, David W. Patten, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde, Parley P. Pratt, Orson Pratt, William Smith, and William E. M'Lellin were received unanimously in their Apostleship, Luke S. Johnson, Lyman E. Johnson, and John F. Boynton were rejected and disfellowshiped, though privileged with confessing and making satisfaction.</p>
<p>Elder Boynton (who was the only one of the three present at the time) arose and endeavored to confess, justifying himself in his former conduct by reason of the failure of the bank.</p>
<p>His conduct was strongly protested against by Elder Brigham Young in a plain and energetic manner, stating various reasons why he could not receive him into fellowship until a hearty repentance and confession were manifested.</p>
<p>Elder Young was followed by Elder Marsh, who acquiesced in testimony and resolutions.</p>
<p>President Rigdon then addressed the assembly, showing the cause of the difficulty with Elders Boynton and Johnson in leaving their calling to attend to other occupations.</p>
<p>Elder Boynton again rose and still attributed his difficulties to the failure of the bank, stating that he understood the bank was instituted by the will of God, and he had been told that it should never fail, let men do what they would.</p>
<p><a name="510" id="510"></a>[Page 510]</p>
<p>President Smith then arose and stated that if this had been declared no one had authority from him for so doing, for he had always said that unless the institution was conducted on righteous principles it would not stand.</p>
<p>A vote was then taken to know if the congregation was satisfied with Elder Boynton's confession; carried in the negative.</p>
<p>Conference adjourned for one hour.</p>
<p>Conference reassembled at two o'clock in the afternoon; opened by reading, singing, and prayer.</p>
<p>The President then arose and said he would call upon the Church to know if they were satisfied with their High Council, and should proceed to name them individually.</p>
<p>John Johnson, Joseph Coe, Joseph C. Kingsbury, and Martin Harris were objected to, also John P. Greene, but his case went over until he should be present.</p>
<p>Noah Packard, Jared Carter, Samuel H. Smith, were sustained.</p>
<p>Oliver Granger, Henry G. Sherwood, William Marks, Mayhew Hillman, Harlow Redfield, Asahel Smith, Phinehas Richards, and David Dort, were chosen to fill the places of those objected to, (and Thomas Grover having moved west) John Smith, chosen one of the presidents of the Church, all having belonged to the High Council.</p>
<p>The President then called upon the congregation to know if the recently appointed presidents of the Seventies should stand in their calling.</p>
<p>Voted that John Gaylord, James Forster, Salmon Gee, Daniel S. Miles, Joseph Young, Josiah Butterfield, and Levi W. Hancock, should retain their offices as presidents of Seventies; John Gould was objected to.</p>
<p>The President then arose and made some remarks concerning the former presidents of the Seventies, the calling and authority of their Priesthood, etc.</p>
<p>Voted that the old presidents of the Seventies [who were High Priests] be referred to the quorum of High Priests; and also, that if any members of the quorum of the Seventies should be dissatisfied and would not submit to the present order and receive these last presidents, the latter should have power to demand their licenses, and the former should no longer be considered members of the Church.</p>
<p>Conference closed by prayer by the President.</p>

<p><em>Announcement concerning Oliver Cowdery.</em></p>
<p>Dear Brethren--Oliver Cowdery has been in transgression, but as he is now chosen as one of the presidents or counselors, I trust that he will yet humble himself and magnify his calling, but if he should not, the Church will soon be under the necessity of raising their hands against him; therefore pray for him.</p>
<p>David Whitmer, Leonard Rich, and others have been in transgression, but we hope that they may be humble and ere long make satisfaction to the Church, otherwise they cannot retain their standing; therefore we say unto you, beware of all disaffected characters, for they come not to build up, but to destroy and scatter abroad. Though we or an angel from heaven preach any other Gospel, or introduce an order of things other than those things which ye have received, and are authorized to receive from the First Presidency, let him be accursed.</p>
<p>May God Almighty bless you all and keep you unto the coming and kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Yours in the bond of the New Covenant,</p>
<p>Joseph Smith, Jun.</p>
<p>I received the following:</p>
<p>Revelation given at Kirtland, Ohio, September 4, 1837, making known the transgression of John Whitmer and William W. Phelps.</p>
<p>Verily thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Joseph--my servants John Whitmer and William W. Phelps have done those things which are not pleasing in my sight, therefore if they repent not they shall be removed out of their places. Amen.</p>

<p>Minutes of a Meeting in the Kirtland Temple.</p>
<p>Sunday, September 10th, 2 o'clock, afternoon, in an assembly of the Church in the Lord's House, Kirtland, President Rigdon read the rules and regulations of the House of the Lord, as passed by the different quorums on the 18th of January, 1836, when the Church voted to receive the same, and be governed by them.</p>
<p>The minutes of the High Council of the 9th instant were read, after which those of the Twelve who were disfellowshiped the previous Sabbath had opportunity to speak; and Luke S. Johnson, Lyman E. Johnson, and John F. Boynton made their confessions and were received into fellowship by vote of the Church, also to retain their apostleship.</p>
<p>President Smith read a letter from Elder Thomas B. Marsh to the Church, stating that before he started from Missouri he had received satisfaction from these Elders. Elder Young also stated the same.</p>
<p>High Councilor John P. Greene made some confessions to the Church, stating wherein he had been wrong for a short time past; and the Church voted that he be received into fellowship and retain his office.</p>
<p>President Rigdon made some observations on the business transacted last Sabbath, reproving some for the conjectures they had respecting President Smith and himself conniving together to remove certain individuals from office, etc., or at least to use their influence to do so. This he informed them was a mistake, for not one word had passed between them on the subject, neither had he a premeditated thought upon the subject.</p>
<p>President Smith then corrected some mistakes of certain individuals which had been circulated by them concerning what he had said on the last Sabbath.</p>
<p>The Lord's Supper was administered by Elders Luke S. and Lyman E. Johnson, and John F. Boynton.</p>

The population of the islands at the time of Elder Woodruff's first visit is given at eighteen hundred, and the following is his description of the people and islands: "The inhabitants are generally wealthy, intelligent, industrious, generous and hospitable to strangers. North Island is nine miles long and two wide, population eight hundred; South Island is ten miles long and five wide, population one thousand." Elder Woodruff met with great success in his labors in this island and soon had a flourishing branch organized.</p>
