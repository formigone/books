<p>Minutes of the High Council of Kirtland--Trial of Almon W. Babbitt.</p>
<p>On the 19th, a charge was preferred before a council of the Presidency, against Elder Almon W. Babbitt, for not keeping the Word of Wisdom; for stating the Book of Mormon was not essential to our salvation, and that we have no articles of faith except the Bible.</p>
<p>Elder J. B. Smith testified that Elder Babbitt had assumed the prerogative of dictating to him in his preaching; and that he was not keeping the Word of Wisdom.</p>
<p>Elder Babbitt said that he had taken the liberty to break the Word of Wisdom, from the example of President Joseph Smith, Jun., and others, but acknowledged that it was wrong; that he had taught the Book of Mormon and Commandments as he had thought to be wisdom, and for the good of the cause; that he had not intended to dictate to Elder J. B. Smith, but only to advise with him.</p>
<p>The council reproved Elder Babbitt, and instructed him to observe the Word of Wisdom, and commandments of the Lord in all things; also that it is not advisable for any Elder to take his wife with him on a mission to preach.</p>

<p>Conference at Saco, Maine.</p>
<p>Seven of the Twelve met in conference at Saco, Maine, August 21st.</p>
<p>The church in that place numbered fifty-seven; the Dover branch in New Hampshire, eight.</p>
<p>The council gave instructions on the redemption of Zion, the building of the Temple in Kirtland, and the printing of the word of God to the nations, etc., etc.; and some were added to the Church during their stay.</p>
<p>The church in Saco contributed seventy or eighty dollar, to assist the Twelve to return home, which the Twelve recorded as a memento in their behalf, according to covenant.</p>

<p><strong>Return of the Prophet to Kirtland.</strong></p>
<p><em>Sunday, August 23rd</em>--I arrived at Kirtland from my visit to Michigan</p>
<p><strong>John E. Page.</strong></p>
<p>On the 24th the High Council at Kirtland ordained Jonathan Stevens an Elder, and instructed him and his sons, Uzziel and Lyman, and his son-in-law, John E. Page, <a class="footnote" href="#fn-1">1</a> Elders, to locate their families and then go forth and preach the Gospel; also that Joseph H. Tippits and J. W. Tippits go to Missouri this fall to purchase land for the church in Essex, New York, according to previous appointment by the voice of said church.</p>
<p><em>August 28.</em>--This day I preached on the duty of wives.</p>
<p><strong>The Conference at Farmington, Maine.</strong></p>
<p>The traveling High Council assembled in conference at Farmington, Maine, and resolved that this be called the "Maine Conference." The church at Farmington numbered thirty-two; in Sitter B., twenty-two; in Akwry, twenty-five; in Errol, New Hampshire, twenty; all in good standing.</p>
<p><strong>The Prophet's Letter to the Elders.</strong></p>
<p><em>September 1.</em>--I wrote the following communication to John Whitmer, Esq., editor, which was published in the <em>Messenger and Advocate,</em> page 179, <em>et seq.:</em></p>
<p>To The Elders of the Church of Latter-day Saints: <a class="footnote" href="#fn-2">2</a></p>
<p>After so long a time, and after so many things have been said, I feel it my duty to drop a few hints, that perhaps the Elders traveling through the world, to warn the inhabitants of the earth to flee the wrath to come, and save themselves from this untoward generation--may be aided in a measure, in doctrine, and in the way of their duty. I have been laboring in this cause for eight years, during which time I have traveled much, and have had much experience. I removed from Seneca County, New York, to Geauga County, Ohio, in February, 1831.</p>
<p><a name="254" id="254"></a>[Page 254]</p>
<p>I received, by a heavenly vision, a commandment in June following, to take my journey to the western boundaries of the State of Missouri, and there designate the very spot which was to be the central place for the commencement of the gathering together of those who embrace the fullness of the everlasting Gospel. Accordingly I undertook the journey, with certain ones of my brethren, and after a long and tedious journey, suffering many privations and hardships, arrived in Jackson County, Missouri, and after viewing the country, seeking diligently at the hand of God, He manifested Himself unto us, and designated, to me and others, the very spot upon which He designed to commence the work of the gathering, and the upbuilding of an "holy city," which should be called Zion--Zion, because it is a place of righteousness, and all who build thereon are to worship the true and living God, and all believe in one doctrine, even the doctrine of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. "Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion" (<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/52.8?lang=eng#7" target="_blank">Isaiah 52:8</a>).</p>
<p>Here we pause for a moment to make a few remarks upon the idea of gathering to this place. It is well known that there were lands belonging to the government, to be sold to individuals, and it was understood by all, at least we believed so, that we lived in a free country, a land of liberty and of laws, guaranteeing to every man, or any company of men, the right of purchasing lands, and settling and living upon them: therefore we thought no harm in advising the Latter-day Saints, or "Mormons," as they are reproachfully called, to gather to this place, inasmuch as it was their duty (and it was well understood so to be) to purchase with money, lands, and live upon them, not infringing upon the rights of any individual, or community of people; always keeping in view the saying, "Do unto others as you would wish others to do unto you;" following also the good injunction, "Deal justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God."</p>
<p>These were our motives in teaching the people, or Latter-day Saints, to gather together, beginning at this place; and inasmuch as there are those who have had different views from this, we feel that it is a cause of deep regret. Be it known unto all men, that our principles concerning this thing have not been such as have been represented by those who, we have every reason to believe, are designing and wicked men, that have said that this was our doctrine: "To infringe upon the rights of a people who inhabit our civil and free country, such as to drive the inhabitants of Jackson County from their lands, and take possession thereof unlawfully." Far, yea, far be such a principle from our hearts. It never entered into our minds; and we only say, that God shall reward such in that day when He shall come to make up His jewels.</p>
<p><a name="255" id="255"></a>[Page 255]</p>
<p>But to return to my subject. After having ascertained the very spot, and having the happiness of seeing quite a number of the families of my brethren comfortably situated upon the land, I took leave of them and journeyed back to Ohio, and used every influence and argument that lay in my power to get those who believed in the everlasting covenant, whose circumstances would admit, and whose families were willing to remove to the place which I had designated to be the land of Zion; and thus the sound of the gathering, and of the doctrine, went abroad into the world; and many, having a zeal not according to knowledge, and not understanding the pure principles of the doctrine of the Church, have, no doubt, in the heat of enthusiasm, taught and said many things which were derogatory to the genuine character and principles of the Church; and for these things we are heartily sorry, and would apologize, if apology would do any good.</p>
<p>But we pause here, and offer a remark upon the saying which we learn has gone abroad, and has been handled in a manner detrimental to the cause of truth, by saying, "that in preaching the doctrine of gathering, we break up families, and give license for men to leave their families, women their husbands, children their parents and slaves their masters, thereby deranging the order and breaking up the harmony and peace of society." We shall here show our faith, and thereby, as we humbly trust, put an end to these false and wicked misrepresentations, which have caused, we have every reason to believe, thousands to think they were doing God's service, when they were persecuting the children of God; whereas, if they could have enjoyed the true light, and had a just understanding of our principles, they would have embraced them with all their hearts, and been rejoicing in the love of the truth. And now to show our doctrine on this subject, we shall commence with the first principles of the Gospel, which are faith, repentance, and baptism for the remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands. This we believe to be our duty--to teach to all mankind the doctrine of repentance, which we shall endeavor to show from the following quotations:</p>
<p>"Then opened He their understandings, that they might understand the scriptures, and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem" (<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/24.45-47?lang=eng#44" target="_blank">Luke 24:45-47</a>).</p>
<p><a name="256" id="256"></a>[Page 256]</p>
<p>By this we learn that it behoved Christ to suffer and to be crucified and rise again on the third day, for the express purpose that repentance and remission of sins should be preached to all nations.</p>
<p>"Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call" (<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/2.38-39?lang=eng#37" target="_blank">Acts 2:38-39</a>).</p>
<p>By this we learn that the promise of the Holy Ghost is made unto as many as those to whom the doctrine of repentance was to be preached, which was unto all nations. And we discover also, that the promise was to extend by lineage; for Peter says, not only unto you, but "to your children, and to all that are afar off." From this we infer, that the promise was to continue unto their children's children, and even unto as many as the Lord their God should call. We discover here that we are blending two principles together in these quotations. The first is the principle of repentance, and the second is the principle of the remission of sins; and we learn from Peter that remission of sins is to be obtained by baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ; and the gift of the Holy Ghost follows inevitably, for, says Peter, "you shall receive the Holy Ghost."</p>
<p>Therefore we believe in preaching the doctrine of repentance in all the world, both to old and young, rich and poor, bond and free, as we shall endeavor to show hereafter how, and in what manner, and how far, it is binding on the consciences of mankind, making proper distinctions between old and young, men, women, children and servants. But we discover, in order to be benefitted by the doctrine of repentance, we must believe in obtaining the remission of sins. And in order to obtain the remission of sins, we must believe in the doctrine of baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And if we believe in baptism for the remission of sins, we may expect a fulfillment of the promise of the Holy Ghost, for the promise extends to all whom the Lord our God shall call; and hath He not surely said, as you will find in the last chapter of Revelation--"And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely" (<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rev/22.17?lang=eng#16" target="_blank">Rev. 22:17</a>).</p>
<p>Again, the Savior says, "Come unto me, all ye that labor, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light" (<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/11.28-30?lang=eng#27" target="_blank">Matt. 11:28-30</a>).</p>
<p>Again, Isaiah says, "Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else. I have sworne by myself, the word is gone out of my month in righteousness and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. Surely shall one say, in the Lord have I righteousness and strength: even to Him shall men come; and all that are incensed against Him shall be ashamed" (<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/45.22-24?lang=eng#21" target="_blank">Isaiah 45:22-24</a>).</p>
<p><a name="257" id="257"></a>[Page 257]</p>
<p>And to show further connections in proof of the doctrine above named, we quote the following scriptures:</p>
<p>"Him hath God exalted with His right hand, to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. And we are His witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey Him" (<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/5.31-32?lang=eng#30" target="_blank">Acts 5:31-32</a>).</p>
<p>"But when they believed Philip, preaching the things concerning the Kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. Then Simon, himself, believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done. Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: (for as yet he was fallen upon none of them, only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost."</p>
<p>"And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water, and the eunuch said, See, here is water, what doth hinder me to be baptized? And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. And he commanded the chariot to stand still, and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him. And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more, and he went on his way rejoicing. But Philip was found at Azotus; and passing through, he preached in all the cities, till he came to Cesarea" (<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/8.12-17?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">Acts 8:12-17;</a> <a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/8.36-40?lang=eng#35" target="_blank">36-40</a>).</p>
<p>"While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word. And they of the circumcision, which believed, were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost, for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. Then answered Peter, Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days" (<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/10.44-48?lang=eng#43" target="_blank">Acts 10:44-48</a>).</p>
<p>"And on the Sabbath, we went out of the city, by a river side where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down and spake unto the women which resorted thither. And a certain woman, named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshiped God, heard us; whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things spoken of by Paul. And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there; and she constrained us" (<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/16.13-15?lang=eng#12" target="_blank">Acts 16:13-15</a>).</p>
<p><a name="258" id="258"></a>[Page 258]</p>
<p>"And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises to God; and the prisoners heard them. And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed. And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword and would have killed himself, supposing the prisoners had been fled. But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm, for we are all here. Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling and fell down before Paul and Silas, and brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. And they spoke unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in the house. And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes, and was baptized, he and all his straightway. And when he had brought them into his house, he set met before them, and rejoiced, believing in God, with all his house" (<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/16.25-34?lang=eng#24" target="_blank">Acts 16:25-34</a>).</p>
<p>"And it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper coasts, came to Ephesus, and finding certain disciples, he said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism. Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on Him which should come after him, that is on Christ Jesus. When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them, and they spake with tongues and prophesied" (<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/19.1-6?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">Acts 19:1-6</a>).</p>
<p>"And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there, came unto me, and stood and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked upon him, and he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee that thou shouldst know His will, and see that Just One, and shouldst hear the word of His mouth. For thou shalt be his witness unto all men, of what thou hast seen and heard. And now, why tarriest thou? Arise and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord" (<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/22.12-16?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">Acts 22:12-16</a>).</p>
<p><a name="259" id="259"></a>[Page 259]</p>
<p>"For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God, and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat. For every one that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe. But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use, have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil" (<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/5.12-14?lang=eng#11" target="_blank">Heb. 5:12-14</a>).</p>
<p>"Therefore, leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, and of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. And this will we do, if God permit. For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance, seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put Him to an open shame" (<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/6.1-6?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">Heb. 6:1-6</a>).</p>
<p>These quotations are so plain, in proving the doctrine of repentance and baptism for the remission of sins, I deem it unnecessary to enlarge this letter with comments upon them; but I shall continue the subject in my next.</p>
<p>In the bonds of the new and everlasting covenant,</p>
<p>Joseph Smith, Jun.</p>
<p>2. To the Elders of the Church of the Latter-day Saints. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-3">3</a></p>
<p>At the close of my letter in the September number of the<em> Messenger and Advocate</em> I promised to continue the subject there commenced. I do so with a hope that it may be a benefit and a means of assistance in the labors of the Elders, while they are combating the prejudices of a crooked and preverse generation, by having in their possession the facts of my religious principles, which are misrepresented by almost all those whose crafts are in danger by the same; and also, to aid those who are anxiously inquiring, and have been excited to do so from rumor, to ascertain correctly what my principles are. I have been drawn into this course of proceeding by persecution, that is brought upon us from false rumors and misrepresentations concerning my sentiments.</p>
<p><a name="260" id="260"></a>[Page 260]</p>
<p>But to proceed. In the letter alluded to, the principles of repentance and baptism for the remission of sins were not only set forth, but many passages of scripture were quoted, clearly elucidating the subject; let me add, I do positively rely upon the truth of those principles inculcated in the New Testament, and then pass on from the above named items, to the item or subject of the gathering, and show my views upon this point. It is a principle I esteem to be of the greatest importance to those who are looking for salvation in this generation, or in these, that may be called, "the latter times." All that the prophets that have written, from the days of righteous Abel, down to the last man that has left any testimony on record for our consideration, in speaking of the salvation of Israel in the last days, goes directly to show that it consists in the work of the gathering.</p>
<p>First, I shall begin by quoting from the prophecy of Enoch, speaking of the last days: "Righteousness will I sent down out of heaven, and truth will I send forth out of the earth, to bear testimony of mine Only Begotten, His resurrection from the dead (this resurrection I understand to be the corporeal body); yea, and also the resurrection of all men; righteousness and truth will I cause to sweep the earth as with a flood, to gather out mine own elect from the four quarters of the earth, unto a place which I shall prepare, a holy city, that my people may gird up their loins, and be looking forth for the time of my coming, for there shall be my tabernacle, and it shall be called Zion, a new Jerusalem" (Pearl of Great Price, ch. 7:62, 1902 edition).</p>
<p>Now I understand by this quotation, that God clearly manifested to Enoch the redemption which He prepared, by offering the Messiah as a Lamb slain from before the foundation of the world; and by virtue of the same, the glorious resurrection of the Savior, and the resurrection of all the human family, even a resurrection of their corporeal bodies, is brought to pass; and also righteousness and truth are to sweep the earth as with a flood. And now, I ask, how righteousness and truth are going to sweep the earth as with a flood? I will answer. Men and angels are to be co-workers in bringing to pass this great work, and Zion is to be prepared, even a new Jerusalem, for the elect that are to be gathered from the four quarters of the earth, and to be established an holy city, for the tabernacle of the Lord shall be with them.</p>
<p>Now Enoch was in good company in his views upon this subject: "And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people and God Himself shall be with them, and be their God" (<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rev/21.3?lang=eng#2" target="_blank">Revelation 21:3</a>).</p>
<p><a name="261" id="261"></a>[Page 261]</p>
<p>I discover by this quotation, that John upon the isle of Patmos, saw the same thing concerning the last days, which Enoch saw. But before the tabernacle can be with men, the elect must be gathered from the four quarters of the earth. And to show further upon this subject of the gathering, Moses, after having pronounced the blessing and cursing upon the children of Israel, for their obedience or disobedience, says thus:</p>
<p>"And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind, among all the nations whither the Lord thy God hath driven thee, and shalt return unto the Lord thy God, and shalt obey His voice, according to all that I command thee, this day, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations whither the Lord thy God hath scattered thee. If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven, from thence will the Lord thy God gather thee, and from thence will He fetch thee" (<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/deut/30.1-4?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">Deut. 30:1-4</a>).</p>
<p>It has been said by many of the learned and wise men, or historians, that the Indians or aborigines of this continent, are of the scattered tribes of Israel. It has been conjectured by many others, that the aborigines of this continent are not of the tribes of Israel, but the ten tribes have been led away unto some unknown regions of the north. Let this be as it may, the prophecy I have just quoted "will fetch them," in the last days, and place them in the land which their fathers possessed. And you will find in the 7th verse of the 30th chapter, quoted, "And the Lord thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee."</p>
<p>Many may say that this scripture is fulfilled, but let them mark carefully what the prophet says: "If any are driven out unto the utmost parts of heaven," (which must mean the breadth of the earth). Now this promise is good to any, if there should be such, that are driven out, even in the last days, therefore, the children of the fathers have claim unto this day. And if these curses are to be laid over on the heads of their enemies, wo be unto the Gentiles. (See Book of Mormon <a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/16?lang=eng" target="_blank">3 Nephi, ch. 16,</a> current edition.) "Wo unto the unbelieving of the Gentiles, saith the Father." And again (see Book of Mormon, <a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/20.22?lang=eng#21" target="_blank">3 Nephi 20:22,</a> current edition, which says), "Behold this people will I establish in this land, unto the fulfilling of the covenant which I made with your father Jacob, and it shall be a New Jerusalem." Now we learn from the Book of Mormon the very identical continent and spot of land upon which the New Jerusalem is to stand, and it must be caught up according to the vision of John upon the isle of Patmos.</p>
<p><a name="262" id="262"></a>[Page 262]</p>
<p>Now many will feel disposed to say, that this New Jerusalem spoken of, is the Jerusalem that was built by the Jews on the eastern continent. But you will see, from <a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rev/21.2?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">Revelation 21:2,</a> there was a New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, adorned as a bride for her husband; that after this, the Revelator was caught away in the Spirit, to a great and high mountain, and saw the great and holy city descending out of heaven from God. Now there are two cities spoken of here. As everything cannot be had in so narrow a compass as a letter, I shall say with brevity, that there is a New Jerusalem to be established on this continent, and also Jerusalem shall be rebuilt on the eastern continent (See Book of Mormon, <a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/13.1-12?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">Ether 13:1-12</a>). "Behold, Ether saw the days of Christ, and he spake also concerning the house of Israel, and the Jerusalem from whence Lehi should come; after it should be destroyed, it should be build up again, a holy city unto the Lord, wherefore it could not be a New Jerusalem, for itÂ had been in a time of old." This may suffice, upon the subject of gathering, until my next.</p>
<p>I now proceed, at the close of my letter, to make a few remarks on the duty of Elders with regard to their teaching parents and children, husbands and wives, masters and slaves, or servants, as I said I would in my former letter.</p>
<p>And first, it becomes an Elder when he is traveling through the world, warning the inhabitants of the earth to gather together, that they may be built up an holy city unto the Lord, instead of commencing with children, or those who look up to parents or guardians to influence their minds, thereby drawing them from their duties, which they rightfully owe these legal guardians, they should commence their labors with parents, or guardians; and their teachings should be such as are calculated to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of children to the fathers; and no influence should be used with children, contrary to the consent of their parents or guardians; but all such as can be persuaded in a lawful and righteous manner, and with common consent, we should feel it our duty to influence them to gather with the people of God. But otherwise let the responsibility rest upon the heads of parents or guardians, and all condemnation or consequences be upon their heads, according to the dispensation which he hath committed unto us; for God hath so ordained, that His work shall be cut short in righteousness, in the last days; therefore, first teach the parents, and then, with their consent, persuade the children to embrace the Gospel also. And if children embrace the Gospel, and their parents or guardians are unbelievers, teach them to stay at home and be obedient to their parents or guardians, if they require it; but if they consent to let them gather with the people of God, let them do so, and there shall be no wrong; and let all things be done carefully and righteously and God will extend to all such His guardian care.</p>
<p><a name="263" id="263"></a>[Page 263]</p>
<p>And secondly, it is the duty of Elders, when they enter into any house, to let their labors and warning voice be unto the master of that house; and if he receive the Gospel, then he may extend his influence to his wife also, with consent, that peradventure she may receive the Gospel; but if a man receive not the Gospel, but gives his consent that his wife may receive it, and she believes, then let her receive it. But if a man forbid his wife, or his children, before they are of age, to receive the Gospel, then it should be the duty of the Elder to go his way, and use no influence against him, and let the responsibility be upon his head; shake off the dust of thy feet as a testimony against him, and thy skirts shall then be clear of their souls. Their sins are not to be answered upon such as God hath sent to warn them to flee the wrath to come, and save themselves from this untoward generation. The servants of God will not have gone over the nations of the Gentiles, with a warning voice, until the destroying angel will commence to waste the inhabitants of the earth, and as the prophet hath said. "It shall be a vexation to hear the report." I speak thus because I feel for my fellow men; I do it in the name of the Lord, being moved upon by the Holy Spirit. Oh, that I could snatch them from the vortex of misery, into which I behold them plunging themselves, by their sins; that I might be enabled by the warning voice, to be an instrument of bringing them to unfeigned repentance, that they might have faith to stand in the evil day!</p>
<p>Thirdly, it should be the duty of an Elder, when he enters into a house, to salute the master of that house, and if he gain his consent, then he may preach to all that are in that house; but if he gain not his consent, let him not go unto his slaves, or servants, but let the responsibility be upon the head of the master of that house, and the consequences thereof, and the guilt of that house is no longer upon his skirts, he is free; therefore, let him shake off the dust of his feet, and go his way. But if the master of that house give consent, the Elder may preach to his family, his wife, his children and his servants, his man-servants, or his maid-servants, or his slaves; then it should be the duty of the Elder to stand up boldly for the cause of Christ, and warn that people with one accord to repent and be baptized for the remission of sins, and for the Holy Ghost, always commanding them in the name of the Lord, in the spirit of meekness, to be kindly affectionate one toward another, that the fathers should be kind to their children, husbands to their wives, masters to their slaves or servants, children obedient to their parents, wives to their husbands, and slaves or servants to their masters.</p>
<p><a name="264" id="264"></a>[Page 264]</p>
<p>"Wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord, for the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the Church; and He is the Savior of the body. Therefore, as the Church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands, in everything. Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church and gave Himself for it, that He might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the Word, that He might present it to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish, so ought men to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife, loveth himself, for no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the Church, for we are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/5.22-31?lang=eng#21" target="_blank">Ephesians 5:22-31</a>).</p>
<p>Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them. Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well pleasing unto the Lord. Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged. Servants, obey in all things your masters, according to the flesh, not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/col/3.18-22?lang=eng#17" target="_blank">Colossians 3:18-22</a>).</p>
<p>But I must close this letter, and resume the subject in another number.</p>
<p>In the bonds of the New and Everlasting Covenant,</p>
<p>Joseph Smith, Jun.</p>
<p>3. To the Elders of The Church of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>I have shown unto you, in my last, that there are two Jerusalems spoken of in holy writ, in a manner I think satisfactory to your minds; at any rate I have given my views upon the subject. I shall now proceed to make some remarks from the sayings of the Savior, recorded in the 13th chapter of His Gospel according to St. Matthew, which, in my mind, afford us as clear an understanding upon the important subject of the gathering, as anything recorded in the Bible. At the time the Savior spoke these beautiful sayings and parables contained in the chapter above quoted, we find Him seated in a ship on account of the multitude that pressed upon Him to hear His words; and He commenced teaching them, saying:</p>
<p><a name="265" id="265"></a>[Page 265]</p>
<p>"Behold, a sower went forth to sow, and when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up: some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth; and forthwith they sprang up because they had no deepness of earth: and when the sun was up they were scorched: and because they had no root they withered away. And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up and choked them: but other fell in good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundred fold, some sixty fold, some thirty fold. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p>"And the disciples came and said unto Him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? [I would here remark, that the 'them' made use of in this interrogation, is a personal pronoun, and refers to the multitude.] He answered and said unto them, [that is unto the disciples,] because it is given untoÂ <em>you</em>Â to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to<em>them,</em>Â [that is, unbelievers,] it is not given; for whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance; but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath."</p>
<p>We understand from this saying, that those who had been previously looking for a Messiah to come, according to the testimony of the Prophets, and were then, at that time looking for a Messiah, but had not sufficient light, on account of their unbelief, to discern Him to be their Savior; and He being the true Messiah, consequently they must be disappointed, and lose even all the knowledge, or have taken away from them all the light, understanding, and faith which they had upon this subject; therefore he that will not receive the greater light, must have taken away from him all the light which he hath; and if the light which is in you become darkness, behold, how great is that darkness! "Therefore," says the Savior, "speak I unto them in parables, because they, seeing, see not, and hearing, they hear not, neither do they understand: and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias which saith, "By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive."</p>
<p>Now we discover that the very reason assigned by this prophet, why they would not receive the Messiah, was, because they did not or would not understand; and seeing, they did not perceive; "for this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, their eyes have closed, lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them." But what saith He to His disciples? "Blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear, for verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them."</p>
<p><a name="266" id="266"></a>[Page 266]</p>
<p>We again make remark here--for we find that the very principle upon which the disciples were accounted blessed, was because they were permitted to see with their eyes and hear with their ears--that the condemnation which rested upon the multitude that received not His saying, was because they were not willing to see with their eyes, and hear with their ears; not because they could not, and were not privileged to see and hear, but because their hearts were full of iniquity and abominations; "as your fathers did, so do ye." The prophet, foreseeing that they would thus harden their hearts, plainly declared it; and herein is the condemnation of the world; that light hath come into the world, and men choose darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil. This is so plainly taught by the Savior, that a wayfaring man need not mistake it.</p>
<p>And again--hear ye the parable of the sower. Men are in the habit, when the truth is exhibited by the servants of God, of saying, All is mystery; they have spoken in parables, and, therefore, are not to be understood. It is true they have eyes to see, and see not, but none are so blind as those who will not see; and, although the Savior spoke this to such characters, yet unto His disciples he expounded it plainly; and we have reason to be truly humble before the God of our fathers, that He hath left these things on record for us, so plain, that notwithstanding the exertions and combined influence of the priests of Baal, they have not power to blind our eyes, and darken our understanding, if we will but open our eyes, and read with candor, for a moment.</p>
<p>But listen to the explanation of the parable of the Sower: "When any one heareth the word of the Kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart." Now mark the expression--that which was sown in his heart. This is he which receiveth seed by the way side. Men who have no principle of righteousness in themselves, and whose hearts are full of iniquity, and have no desire for the principles of truth, do not understand the word of truth when they hear it. The devil taketh away the word of truth out of their hearts, because there is no desire for righteousness in them. "But he that receiveth seed in stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon, with joy receiveth it; yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by, he is offended. He also that receiveth seed among the thorns, is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it, which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundred fold, some sixty, some thirty." Thus the Savior Himself explains unto His disciples the parable which He put forth, and left no mystery or darkness upon the minds of those who firmly believe on His words.</p>
<p><a name="267" id="267"></a>[Page 267]</p>
<p>We draw the conclusion, then, that the very reason why the multitude, or the world, as they were designated by the Savior, did not receive an explanation upon His parables, was because of unbelief. To you, He says, (speaking to His disciples,) it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of God. And why? Because of the faith and confidence they had in Him. This parable was spoken to demonstrate the effects that are produced by the preaching of the word; and we believe that it has an allusion directly, to the commencement, or the setting up of the Kingdom in that age; therefore we shall continue to trace His sayings concerning this Kingdom from that time forth, even unto the end of the world.</p>
<p>"Another parable put He forth unto them, saying, [which parable has an allusion to the setting up of the Kingdom, in that age of the world also.] The Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field, but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also; so the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? From whence, then, hath it tares? He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn."</p>
<p>Now we learn by this parable, not only the setting up of the Kingdom in the days of the Savior, which is represented by the good seed, which produced fruit, but also the corruptions of the Church, which are represented by the tares, which were sown by the enemy, which His disciples would fain have plucked up, or cleansed the Church of, if their views had been favored by the Savior. But He, knowing all things, says, Not so. As much as to say, your views are not correct, the Church is in its infancy, and if you take this rash step, you will destroy the wheat, or the Church, with the tares; therefore it is better to let them grow together until the harvest, or the end of the world, which means the destruction of the wicked, which is not yet fulfilled, as we shall show hereafter, in the Savior's explanation of the parable, which is so plain that there is no room left for dubiety upon the mind, notwithstanding the cry of the priests--"parables, parables! figures, figures! mystery, mystery! all is mystery!" But we find no room for doubt here, as the parables were all plainly elucidated.</p>
<p><a name="268" id="268"></a>[Page 268]</p>
<p>And again, another parable put He forth unto them, having an allusion to the Kingdom that should be set up, just previous to or at the time of the harvest, which reads as follows--"The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field: which indeed is the least of all seeds: but, when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof." Now we can discover plainly that this figure is given to represent the Church as it shall come forth in the last days. Behold, the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto it. Now, what is like unto it?</p>
<p>Let us take the Book of Mormon, which a man took and hid in his field, securing it by his faith, to spring up in the last days, or in due time; let us behold it coming forth out of the ground, which is indeed accounted the least of all seeds, but behold it branching forth, yea, even towering, with lofty branches, and God-like majesty, until it, like the mustard seed, becomes the greatest of all herbs. And it is truth, and it has sprouted and come forth out of the earth, and righteousness begins to look down from heaven, and God is sending down His powers, gifts and angels, to lodge in the branches thereof.</p>
<p>The Kingdom of heaven is like unto a mustard seed. Behold, then is not this the Kingdom of heaven that is raising its head in the last days in the majesty of its God, even the Church of the Latter-day Saints, like an impenetrable, immovable rock in the midst of the mighty deep, exposed to the storms and tempests of Satan, but has, thus far, remained steadfast, and is still braving the mountain waves of opposition, which are driven by the tempestuous winds of sinking crafts, which have [dashed] and are still dashing with tremendous foam across its triumphant brow; urged onward with redoubled fury by the enemy of righteousness, with his pitchfork of lies, as you will see fairly represented in a cut contained in Mr. Howe's<em>Mormonism Unveiled?</em>Â And we hope that this adversary of truth will continue to stir up the sink of iniquity, that the people may the more readily discern between the righteous and the wicked.</p>
<p>We also would notice one of the modern sons of Sceva, who would fain have made people believe that he could cast out devils, by a certain pamphlet, theÂ <em>Millennial Harbinger,</em>Â that went the rounds through our country; who felt so fully authorized to brand "Jo" Smith with the appellation of Elymas the sorcerer, and to say with Paul, "O full of all subtlety, and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?" We would reply to this gentleman, Paul we know, and Christ we know, but who are ye? And with the best of feeling would say to him, in the language of Paul to those who said they were John's disciples, but had not so much as heard there was a Holy Ghost--to repent and be baptized for the remission of sins, by those who have legal authority, and under their hands you shall receive the Holy Ghost, according to the Scriptures:Â <a href="https://byustudies-dev.byu.edu/hc/2/21.html#fn-4">4</a></p>
<p><a name="269" id="269"></a>[Page 269]</p>
<p>"Then laid theyÂ <em>their</em>Â hands upon them, and they received the Holy Ghost (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/8.17?lang=eng#16" target="_blank">Acts 8:17</a>). "And when Paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/19.6?lang=eng#5" target="_blank">Acts 19:6</a>). "Of the doctrine of baptism, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/6.2?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">Hebrews 6:2</a>). "How, then, shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach, except they be sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/10.14-5?lang=eng#13" target="_blank">Romans 10:14-5</a>). But if this man will not take our admonition, but will persist in his wicked course, we hope that he will continue trying to cast out devils, that we may have the clearer proof that the kingdom of Satan is divided against itself, and consequently cannot stand; for a kingdom divided against itself, speedily hath an end.</p>
<p>If we were disposed to take this gentleman upon his own ground, and justly heap upon him that which he so readily and unjustly heaps upon others, we might go farther--we might say that he has wickedly and maliciously lied about, villified and traduced the characters of innocent men. We might invite the gentleman to a public investigation of these matters, yea, and we do challenge him to an investigation upon any or all principles wherein he feels opposed to us, in public or in private. We might farther say that we could introduce him toÂ <em>Mormonism Unveiled,</em>Â also to the right honorable Dr. Philastus Hurlburt, who is the legitimate author of the same, who is not so much a doctor of physics as of falsehood, or doctor by name.</p>
<p><a name="270" id="270"></a>[Page 270]</p>
<p>We could also give him an introduction to the Reverend Mr. Howe, the illegitimate author ofÂ <em>Mormonism Unveiled,</em>Â in order to give currency to the publication, as Mr. Hurlburt about this time was bound over to court for threatening life. He is also an associate of the celebrated Mr. Clapp, who has of late immortalized his name, by swearing that he would not believe a Mormon under oath; and by his polite attention to Hurlburt's wife, which cost him (as we are informed) a round sum. Also his son Matthew testified, that the Book of Mormon had been proved false an hundred times, by Howe's book; and also that he would not believe a Mormon under oath. And also we could mention the Rev. Mr. Bentley, who, we believe, has been actively engaged in injuring the character of his brother-in-law, viz., Elder Sidney Rigdon.</p>
<p>Now the above statements are according to our best information, and we believe them to be true, and this is as fair a sample of the doctrine of Campbellism as we ask, taking the statements of these gentlemen, and judging them by their fruits; and we might add many more to the black catalogue; even the ringleaders not of the Nazarenes, (for how can any good thing come out of Nazareth) but of the far-famed Mentor mob, all sons and legitimate heirs of the same spirit of Alexander Campbell, andÂ <em>Mormonism Unveiled,</em>Â according to the representation of the cut spoken of above.</p>
<p>The above clouds of darkness have long been beating like mountain waves upon the immovable rock of the Church of the Latter-day Saints; and notwithstanding all this, the mustard seed is still towering its lofty branches, higher and higher, and extending itself wider and wider; and the chariot wheels of the Kingdom are still rolling on, impelled by the mighty arm of Jehovah; and in spite of all opposition, will still roll on, until His words are all fulfilled.</p>
<p>Our readers will excuse us for deviating from the subject, when they take into consideration the abuses that have been heaped upon us heretofore, which we have tamely submitted to, until forbearance is no longer required at our hands. Having frequently turned both the right and left cheek, we believe it our duty now to stand up in our own defense. With these remarks we shall proceed with the subject of the gathering.</p>
<p>"And another parable spake He unto them. The Kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened." It may be understood that the Church of the Latter-day Saints has taken its rise from a little leaven that was put into three witnesses. Behold, how much this is like the parable! It is fast leavening the lump, and will soon leaven the whole. But let us pass on.</p>
<p><a name="271" id="271"></a>[Page 271]</p>
<p>"All these things spoke Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spoke He not unto them: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world. Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house; and His disciples came unto Him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of Man; the field is the world; the good seed are the children of the Kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one." Now let our readers mark the expression--"the field is the world, the tares are the children of the wicked one, the enemy that sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the end of the world, [let them carefully mark this expression--<em>the end of the world,</em>] and the reapers are the angels."</p>
<p>Now men cannot have any possible grounds to say that this is figurative, or that it does not mean what it says; for he is now explaining what He has previously spoken in parables; and according to this language, the end of the world is the destruction of the wicked, the harvest and the end of the world have an allusion directly to the human family in the last days, instead of the earth, as many have imagined; and that which shall precede the coming of the Son of Man, and the restitution of all things spoken of by the mouth of all the holy prophets since the world began; and the angels are to have something to do in this great work, for they are the reapers. As, therefore, the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so shall it be in the end of the world; that is, as the servants of God go forth warning the nations, both priests and people, and as they harden their hearts and reject the light of truth, these first being delivered over to the buffetings of Satan, and the law and the testimony being closed up, as it was in the case of the Jews, they are left in darkness, and delivered over unto the day of burning; thus being bound up by their creeds, and their bands being made strong by their priests, are prepared for the fulfillment of the saying of the Savior--"The Son of Man shall send forth His angels, and gather out of His Kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity, and shall cast them into a furnace of fire, there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth." We understand that the work of gathering together of the wheat into barns, or garners, is to take place while the tares are being bound over, and preparing for the day of burning; that after the day of burnings, the righteous shall shine forth like the sun, in the Kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p>But to illustrate more clearly this gathering: We have another parable--"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hid in a field, the which, when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof, goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field!" The Saints work after this pattern. See the Church of the Latter-day Saints, selling all that they have, and gathering themselves together unto a place that they may purchase for an inheritance, that they may be together and bear each other's afflictions in the day of calamity.</p>
<p><a name="272" id="272"></a>[Page 272]</p>
<p>"Again, the Kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchantman seeking goodly pearls, who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it." The Saints again work after this example. See men traveling to find places for Zion and her stakes or remnants, who, when they find the place for Zion, or the pearl of great price, straightway sell that they have, and buy it.</p>
<p>"Again, the Kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind, which when it was full they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away." For the work of this pattern, behold the seed of Joseph, spreading forth the Gospel net upon the face of the earth, gathering of every kind, that the good may be saved in vessels prepared for that purpose, and the angels will take care of the bad. So shall it be at the end of the world--the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just, and cast them into the furnace of fire, and there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p>"Jesus saith unto them, Have you understood all these things? They say unto Him, Yea, Lord." And we say, yea, Lord; and well might they say, yea, Lord; for these things are so plain and so glorious that every Saint in the last days must respond with a hearty Amen to them.</p>
<p>"Then said He unto them, therefore every scribe which is instructed in the kingdom of heaven, is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things that are new and old."</p>
<p>For the works of this example, see the Book of Mormon coming forth out of the treasure of the heart. Also the covenants given to the Latter-day Saints, also the translation of the Bible--thus bringing forth out of the heart things new and old, thus answering to three measures of meal undergoing the purifying touch by a revelation of Jesus Christ, and the ministering of angels, who have already commenced this work in the last days, which will answer to the leaven which leavened the whole lump. Amen.</p>
<p>So I close, but shall continue the subject in another number.Â <a href="https://byustudies-dev.byu.edu/hc/2/21.html#fn-5">5</a></p>
<p>In the bonds of the New and Everlasting Covenant,</p>
<p>Joseph Smith, Jun.</p>
<p>Chapter 19</p>
<p><a name="fn-1" id="fn-1"></a>1. John E. Page was born February 25, 1799, in Trenton Township, Oneida County, New York. He was baptized by the brother of Martin Harris--Emer Harris--in August, 1833, in Ohio, and ordained an Elder in September, 1833. He was now, on his removal to Kirtland, in his thirty-sixth year.</p>
<p><a name="fn-2" id="fn-2"></a>2. This is a most important document, since in it the Prophet reviews the actions and motives of himself and associates in settling the Church in Missouri. It is a most just and conservative statement of the case, a statement in which the errors and overzeal of some of the Elders and Ssaints are admitted and deplored. It also admirably portrays the Prophet as the conservative force in the Church, and gives an insight into the greatness and inspiration of his mind.</p>
<p><a name="fn-3" id="fn-3"></a>3. It has been decided to let the several divisions of this communication to the Elders of the Church appear together in this one chapter. There were three separate communication of the Prophet, as they appear in theÂ <em>Messenger and Advocate</em>Â for September, November and December, 1835, respectively; but they constitute one continuous address, it is believed that it will in every way be better to have them appear together in one chapter.</p>
<p><a name="fn-4" id="fn-4"></a>4. In this and several of the following paragraphs the Prophet alludes to Alexander Campbell, founder of the sect of the "Disciples;" and also to an article which appeared in theÂ <em>Millennial Harbinger,</em>Â Vol. 2 (1831), pages 86-96. The reference to Elymas, to which the Prophet so strongly replies, stands thus in Campbell's article--which was afterwards circulated as a pamphlet: "I have never felt so fully authorized to address mortal man in the style in which Paul addressed Elymas the sorcerer as I feel towards this atheist Smith." (<em>Millennial Harbinger,</em>Â Vol. 2, p. 96). That is, "O full of all subtlety and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/13.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">Acts 13:10</a>).</p>
<p>The paragraph dealing with the laying on of hands, and the passages of scripture quoted in support of that doctrine. will also be the better understood when it is known that while Mr. Campbell and his associates taught faith in God, repentance and baptism for the remission of sins, they rejected wholly the doctrine of the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the enjoyment of the spiritual blessings which accompany the possession of that Spirit.</p>
