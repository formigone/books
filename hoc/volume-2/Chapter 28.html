<p><strong>Further Arrangements for the Study of Hebrew.</strong></p>
<p><em>Monday, February 1, 1836</em>--Attended school as usual, and in company with the other members of the committee organized another class of thirty, to receive Mr. Seixas' lectures on the Hebrew.</p>
<p>In the evening, attended to the organizing of the quorums of High Priests, Elders, Seventy, and Bishops, in the upper rooms of the house of the Lord, and after blessing each quorum in the name of the Lord, I returned home. I had another interview with Mr. Seixas, our Hebrew teacher, and related to him some of the dealings of God with me, and gave him some of the evidence of the truth of the work of the latter days. He listened cordially and did not oppose.</p>
<p><em>Tuesday 2.</em>--Attended school as usual, and to various other duties.</p>
<p><strong>The Gathering of Israel.</strong></p>
<p>Went to the school house in the evening, and heard an animated discourse delivered by President Rigdon. He touched on the outlines of our faith, showed the scattering and gathering of Israel, from the Scriptures, and the stick of Joseph in the hands of Ephraim, as also from the scriptures of Moses. It was an interesting meeting, the Spirit bore record that the Lord was well pleased.</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 3.</em>--Morning, attended our Hebrew lecture.</p>
<p><strong>Names for the Second Quorum of Seventy.</strong></p>
<p>Afternoon, studied with Oliver Cowdery and Sylvester Smith. Received many visitors, and showed them the Records of Abraham. My father blessed three with a patriarchal blessing. President Alva Beaman handed in seventy of his quorum designed for another Seventy if God will.</p>
<p><a name="391" id="391"></a>[Page 391]</p>
<p><strong>Hebrew Class Arrangements</strong></p>
<p><em>Thursday, 4.</em>--Attended school, and assisted in forming a class of twenty-two members to read at three o'clock, p. m. The other twenty-three read at eleven o'clock. The first class recites at a quarter before ten, a. m., and the second a quarter before two, p. m. We have a great want of books, but are determined to do the best we can. May the Lord help us to obtain this language, that we may read the Scriptures in the language in which they were given.</p>
<p><em>Friday, 5.</em>--Attended school, and assisted the committee to make arrangements to supply the third and fourth classes with books; concluded to divide a Bible into several parts, for the benefit of said classes; continued my studies in the Hebrew; received several visitors, and attended various duties.</p>
<p><strong>Arrangements of Quorums to Receive Spiritual Blessings.</strong></p>
<p><em>Saturday, 6.</em>--Called the anointed together to receive the seal of all their blessings. The High Priests and Elders in the council room as usual, the Seventy with the Twelve in the second room, and the Bishops in the third. I labored with each of these quorums for some time to bring them to the order which God had shown to me, which is as follows: The first part to be spent in solemn prayer before God, without any talking or confusion; and the conclusion with a sealing prayer by President Rigdon, when all the quorums were to shout with one accord a solemn hosanna to God and the Lamb, with an Amen, Amen and Amen; and then all take seats and lift up their hearts in silent prayer to God, and if any obtain a prophecy or vision, to rise and speak that all may be edified and rejoice together.</p>
<p>I had considerable trouble to get all the quorums united in this order. I went from room to room repeatedly, and charged each separately, assuring them that it was according to the mind of God, yet, notwithstanding all my labor, while I was in the east room with the Bishops' quorum, I felt, by the Spirit, that something was wrong in the quorum of Elders in the west room, and I immediately requested Presidents Oliver Cowdery and Hyrum Smith to go in and see what was the matter. The quorum of Elders had not observed the order which I had given them, and were reminded of it by President Don Carlos Smith, and mildly requested to preserve order, and continue in prayer. Some of them replied that they had a teacher of their own, and did not wish to be troubled by others. This caused the Spirit of the Lord to withdraw; this interrupted the meeting, and this quorum lost their blessing in a great measure.</p>
<p><a name="392" id="392"></a>[Page 392]</p>
<p>The other quorums were more careful, and the quorum of the Seventy enjoyed a great flow of the Holy Spirit. Many arose and spoke, testifying that they were filled with the Holy Ghost, which was like fire in their bones, so that they could not hold their peace, but were constrained to cry hosanna to God and the Lamb, and glory in the highest.</p>
<p><strong>Visions in the Kirtland Temple.</strong></p>
<p>President William Smith, one of the Twelve, saw a vision of the Twelve, and Seven in council together in old England, and prophesied that a great work would be done by them in the old countries, and God was already beginning to work in the hearts of the people.</p>
<p>President Zebedee Coltrin, one of the Seven, saw a vision of the Lord's host. And others were filled with the Spirit, and spake with tongues and prophesied. This was a time of rejoicing long to be remembered. Praise the Lord.</p>
<p><em>Sunday, 7.</em>--Attended meeting at the usual hour. The quorums were seated according to their official standing in the Church. The Bishop of Zion and his counselors occupied the forenoon in confession and exhortation. The Bishop of Kirtland and his counselors occupied the stand in the afternoon. The discourses of these two quorums were interesting. A number of letters of commendation were presented and read, a vote was called, and all were received into the Church in Kirtland. Bread was broken and blessed, and while it was passing, President Rigdon commenced speaking from <a class="scriplink" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/Acts/2/1#1">Acts 2</a>, and continued about fifteen minutes. His reasoning was good. The wine was then blessed and passed, after which meeting dismissed.</p>
<p><a name="393" id="393"></a>[Page 393]</p>
<p>In the evening, met with the Presidency in the loft of the printing office, in company with the presidency of the Seventy, to choose other Seventy also. Blessed one of the Zion brethren. Dismissed and retired.</p>
<p><em>Monday, 8.</em>--Attended school at the usual hour.</p>
<p><strong>Warren Parrish Resumes his Duty as Scribe.</strong></p>
<p>In the afternoon, lectured in the upper room of the printing office with some of the brethren. At evening, visited Mr. Seixas, in company with Presidents Rigdon and Cowdery. He conversed freely; is an interesting man. Elder Parrish, my scribe, received my journal again. His health is so much improved, that he thinks he will be able, with the blessing of God, to perform his duty.</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 9.</em>--Spent the day in studying the Hebrew language. Fine weather and sleighing. Evening at home.</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 10.</em>--At ten o'clock, met at the school room to read Hebrew.</p>
<p>Afternoon, read in the upper room of the printing office.</p>
<p><strong>Hyrum Smith Meets with an Accident.</strong></p>
<p>At four o'clock, called at the school room in the Temple to make some arrangements concerning the classes. On my return, I was informed that Brother Hyrum Smith had cut himself. I immediately repaired to his house, and found him badly wounded in his left arm, he had fallen on his ax, which caused a wound about four or five inches in length. Doctor Williams sewed it up and dressed it, and I feel to thank God that it is no worse, and I ask my Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ to heal my brother Hyrum, and bless my father's family, one and all, with peace and plenty, and eternal life.</p>
<p><a name="394" id="394"></a>[Page 394]</p>
<p><em>Thursday, 11.</em>--Attended school, and read Hebrew with the morning class.</p>
<p>Spent the afternoon in reading, and in exhibiting the Egyptian records to those who called to see me, and heaven's blessings have attended me.</p>
<p><em>Friday, 12.</em>--Spent the day in reading Hebrew, and attending to the duties of my family, and the duties of the Church.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks of the Prophet on Those Unworthy of the Ministry.</strong></p>
<p>I met in company with the several quorums in the school room in the temple, at evening, to take into consideration the subject of ordination. I made some remarks upon the subject of our meeting, which were as follows: Many are desiring to be ordained to the ministry, who are not called, consequently the Lord is displeased. Secondly, many already have been ordained, who ought not to hold official stations in the Church, because they dishonor themselves and the Church, and bring persecution swiftly upon us, in consequence of their zeal without knowledge. I requested the quorums to take some measures to regulate the same. I proposed some resolutions, and remarked to the brethren that the subject was now before them, and open for discussion.</p>
<p>The subject was discussed by Presidents Sidney Rigdon and Oliver Cowdery, and Elder Martin Harris, and others, and resolutions were drafted by my scribe (who served as clerk on the occasion), read, and rejected. It was then proposed that I should indite resolutions, which I did as follows:</p>
<p>The Prophet's Draft of Resolutions.</p>
<p>First. Resolved--That no one be ordained to any office in the Church in this stake of Zion, at Kirtland, without the unanimous voice of the several bodies that constitute this quorum, who are appointed to do Church business in the name of said Church, viz., the Presidency of the Church; the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb; the twelve High Councilors of Kirtland; the twelve High Councilors of Zion; the Bishop of Kirtland and his counselors; the Bishop of Zion and his counselors; and the seven presidents of Seventies; until otherwise ordered by said quorums.</p>
<p><a name="395" id="395"></a>[Page 395]</p>
<p>Second. And further Resolved--That no one be ordained in the branches of said Church abroad, unless they are recommended by the voice of the respective branches of the Church to which they belong, to a general conference appointed by the heads of the Church, and from that conference receive their ordination. The foregoing resolutions were concurred in by the presidents of the Seventies.</p>
<p><em>Saturday, 13.</em>--Spent the day in reading Hebrew.</p>
<p>At noon I prepared a horse and sleigh for Professor Seixas to go to Hudson and see his family.</p>
<p>Action of the Twelve on the Resolutions Governing Ordinations.</p>
<p>At one o'clock p. m. the council of the Twelve Apostles met in the house of the Lord, and after prayer and consultation upon the nature and expediency of the preceding resolutions offered in council on the 12th instant, it was unanimously agreed to offer the following amendment to the second resolution, (perfectly acquiescing in the first) viz.: That none be ordained to any office in the branches to which they belong; but to be recommended to a general conference appointed by those, or under the direction of those, who are designated in the book of Doctrine and Covenants, as having authority to ordain and set in order all the officers of the Church abroad, and from that conference receive their ordination.</p>
<p>Thomas B. Marsh, Chairman.</p>
<p>Orson Hyde,</p>
<p>Wm. E. M'Lellin, Clerks.</p>
<p><em>Sunday, 14.</em>--Attended to the ordinance of baptism before meeting.</p>
<p><strong>The Faith and Confidence of Seventy.</strong></p>
<p>At the usual hour attended meeting. The presidents of the Seventy expressed their feelings on the occasion, and their faith in the Book of Mormon and the revelations, also their entire confidence in all the quorums that are organized in the Church of Latter-day Saints. A good time--the Spirit of God rested upon the congregation. Administered the Sacrament, and confirmed a number that had been baptized, and then dismissed the meeting.</p>
<p><a name="396" id="396"></a>[Page 396]</p>
<p><em>Monday 15.</em>--Attended school at the usual hours.</p>
<p><strong>Progress in the Study of Hebrew.</strong></p>
<p>Spent the afternoon in reading Hebrew and in receiving and waiting on visitors. On this day we commenced translating the Hebrew language, under the instruction of Professor Seixas, and he stated that we were the most forward of any class he ever instructed for the same length of time.</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 16.</em>--Attended school at the usual hour. Resumed our translating, and made rapid progress. Many called to see the House of the Lord, and the Egyptian manuscript, and to visit me. Extremely cold weather, and fine sleighing.</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 17.</em>--Attended the school and read and translated with my class as usual. My soul delights in reading the word of the Lord in the original, and I am determined to pursue the study of the languages, until I shall become master of them, if I am permitted to live long enough. At any rate, so long as I do live, I am determined to make this my object; and with the blessing of God, I shall succeed to my satisfaction.</p>
<p>Elder Coe called to make some arrangements about the Egyptian mummies and records. He proposes to hire a room at John Johnson's Inn, and exhibit them there from day to day, at certain hours, that some benefit may be derived from them. I complied with his request, and only observed that they must be managed with prudence and care, especially the manuscripts.</p>
<p>Action of the Kirtland High Council on the Resolutions on Ordinations.</p>
<p>The High Council of Kirtland met in the House of the Lord at six o'clock, p. m., to discuss the subject of ordination, as laid before the Council on the 12th instant; and also the proposed amendment of the Twelve Apostles of the 13th. After discussing the resolutions drawn by President Smith, it was voted unanimously that they should remain entire, and the proposed amendment of the Twelve Apostles be rejected.</p>
<p>Joseph C. Kingsbury, Clerk.</p>
<p><a name="397" id="397"></a>[Page 397]</p>
<p><em>Thursday, 18.</em>--Spent the day as usual in attending to my family concerns, receiving and waiting upon those who called for instructions, and attending to my studies.</p>
<p>Action of the High Council of Zion on the Resolution on Ordinations.</p>
<p>The High Council of Zion met in the upper room of the printing office at seven o'clock p.m. to discuss the subject of ordination, as laid before them in the council of the 12th instant, and also the amendment of the Twelve Apostles. After discussing the resolutions drawn up by the President, it was voted unanimously that they should remain, and that we perfectly acquiesce in said resolutions without any alteration or amendment.</p>
<p>Elias Higbee, Clerk.</p>
<p><strong>The Prophet's Regard for Prof. Seixas.</strong></p>
<p><em>Friday, 19.</em>--Attended with the morning class and translated. Professor Seixas handed me the names of a few whom he had selected from the first class, and requested us to meet together this afternoon and lecture, which we did, in the upper room of the printing office. The names are as follows: Presidents Sidney Rigdon, Oliver Cowdery, William W. Phelps, Bishop Edward Partridge, Elders William E. M'Lellin, Orson Hyde, Orson Pratt, Sylvester Smith, myself, and scribe. These, and Prof. Seixas, to meet one hour on the following morning.</p>
<p>I conversed with Mr. Seixas on the subject of religion, at my house this afternoon. He listened with attention, and appeared interested with my remarks. And I believe the Lord is striving with him, by His Holy Spirit, and that he will eventually embrace the new and everlasting covenant, for he is a chosen vessel unto the Lord to do His people good; but I forbear lest I get to prophesying upon his head.</p>
<p><a name="398" id="398"></a>[Page 398]</p>
<p>This evening President Rigdon and myself called at Mr. Seixas' lodgings and conversed with him upon the subject of the school. Had a pleasant interview.</p>
<p><em>Saturday, 20.</em>--At home attending to my domestic concerns.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock attended the school, and translated with the morning class.</p>
<p>Spent the afternoon with my class in the printing office and the evening at home.</p>
<p><strong>The Varied Activities of the Prophet.</strong></p>
<p><em>Sunday, 21.</em>--Spent the day at home in reading, meditation and prayer. I reviewed my lesson in Hebrew. Some three or four persons were baptized, and the powers of darkness seem to be giving way on all sides. Many who have been enemies to the work of the Lord, are beginning to enquire into the faith of the Latter-day Saints, and are friendly.</p>
<p><em>Monday, 22.</em>--Translated Hebrew with the first class in the morning. Returned home and made out my returns, to the county clerk on eleven marriages which I had solemnized within three months--eight by license from the clerk of the court of common pleas in Geauga County, Ohio, and three by publishment. Sent them to Chardon by Elijah Fuller. I baptized John O. Waterman.</p>
<p>Spent the afternoon translating with my scribe, Elder Warren Parrish, at his house.</p>
<p>At four o'clock met Professor Seixas and the school committee at the printing office, to make some arrangements for the advancement of the several classes.</p>
<p>Action of the First Presidency on the Resolutions on Ordinations.</p>
<p>The Presidency of the Church met and took in consideration the resolutions presented to the Twelve Apostles, (dated Feb. 12th), the presidents of Seventies, the High Councils of the Church for Zion and Kirtland. After due deliberation it was unanimously agreed that the original resolutions be adopted without amendments.</p>
<p><a name="399" id="399"></a>[Page 399]</p>
<p>Oliver Cowdery, Clerk of Council.</p>
<p>The lower room of the Temple is now prepared for painting. Elder Brigham Young was obliged to leave the Hebrew class and superintend the painting of the lower room until finished. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-1">1</a></p>
<p>This afternoon the sisters met to make the veil of the Temple. Father Smith presided over them, and gave them much good instruction. Closed by singing and prayer, which is customary at the commencement and close of all councils and meetings of the Church of Latter-day Saints, although not always mentioned in this record.</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 23.</em>--Read and translated Hebrew.</p>
<p>This afternoon the sisters met again at the Temple to work on the veil. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-2">2</a></p>
<p>Towards the close of the day I met with the Presidency and many of the brethren in the house of the Lord, and made some remarks from the pulpit upon the rise and progress of the Church of Christ of Latter-day Saints, and pronounced a blessing upon the sisters, for their liberality in giving their services so cheerfully, to make the veil for the Lord's House; also upon the congregation; and dismissed.</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 24.</em>--Attended to my studies as usual.</p>
<p><strong>The Selection of Men for the Ministry.</strong></p>
<p>In the evening, met the quorums at the school room in the Temple to take into consideration the propriety or impropriety of ordaining a large number of individuals who wish to be ordained to official stations in the Church. Each individual's name was presented and the voice of the assembly called; and William Wightman, Charles Wightman, David Cluff, Truman Jackson, Reuben Barton, Daniel Miles, and Moses Daily, were received, and nineteen were rejected. Their ordinations deferred until another time. Presidents Orson Hyde, Oliver Cowdery, and Sylvester Smith, were nominated to draft rules and regulations concerning licenses, and by vote of the assembly passed unanimously.</p>
<p><a name="400" id="400"></a>[Page 400]</p>
<p>Thomas Burdick was chosen by nomination to officiate as clerk, to record licenses, and is to receive pay for his services. Also voted that the Twelve and Seventy see that the calls for preaching in the region round about Kirtland be attended to, and filled by judicious Elders of this Church.</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 25.</em>--Attended to my studies as usual, and made some advancement.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I was called upon by Elder Rigdon to go and see his wife, who was very sick. I did so in company with my scribe. We prayed for her and anointed her in the name of the Lord, and she began to recover from that very hour. Returned home and spent the evening there.</p>
<p><em>Friday, 26.</em>--Read Hebrew with the first class in the morning.</p>
<p>Spent the afternoon in the printing office. Settled some misunderstanding between Brother William Smith and Professor Seixas.</p>
<p><em>Saturday 27.</em>--Cold, and fine sleighing. I prepared my horse and sleigh for Mr. Seixas to ride to Hudson and visit his family, to return on Monday next. Attended with my class at the printing office, both in the forenoon and afternoon, lectured and also translated Hebrew.</p>
<p><strong>Respectful Inquiries About the Work.</strong></p>
<p><em>Sunday, 28.</em>--This morning two gentlemen, late from Scotland, called to see me, to make inquiries about the work of the Lord in these last days. They treated me with respect, and the interview was pleasing to me, and I presume interesting to them. They attended our meeting with me, and expressed satisfaction at what they heard. They spoke of Irving, <a class="footnote" href="#fn-3">3</a> the religious reformer, and his prophecies. After meeting I returned home and spent the after part of the day and evening in reading and translating the Hebrew.</p>
<p><a name="401" id="401"></a>[Page 401]</p>
<p><strong>The Manliness of Elder Morey.</strong></p>
<p><em>Monday, 29.</em>--Spent the day in studying as usual. A man called to see the House of the Lord, in company with another gentleman. On entering the door they were politely invited, by the gentleman who had charge of the house, to take off their hats. One of them replied with the request unhesitatingly, while the other observed that he would not take off his hat nor bow to "Jo Smith," but that he had made "Jo" bow to him at a certain time. He was immediately informed by Elder Morey, the keeper of the house, that his first business was to leave, for when a man insulted Joseph Smith he, Brother Morey, was himself insulted. The man manifested much anger, but left the house. For this independence and resolution of Elder Morey, I respect him, and for the love he manifested towards me; and may Israel's God bless him, and give him an ascendency over all his enemies.</p>
<p>This afternoon Professor Seixas returned from Hudson and brought a few more Hebrew Bibles and one grammar of his second edition. Weather warm and sleighing failing fast.</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, March 1, 1836.</em>--Attended school in the forenoon.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, at the printing office, and read and translated with my class until four o'clock. Returned home and attended to my domestic concerns. We have as yet fine sleighing, which is uncommon in this country at this season of the year.</p>
<p><a name="402" id="402"></a>[Page 402]</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 2.</em>--Pursued my studies as usual.</p>
<p>At seven o'clock in the evening the first class met, agreeable to the request of Mr. Seixas, at Elder Orson Hyde's, to spend one hour in translating. Returned at eight o'clock.</p>
<p><strong>Misunderstanding Over Sale of Bibles.</strong></p>
<p><em>Thursday, 3.</em>--Attended to my studies in the Hebrew school. Some misunderstanding took place between Professor Seixas and some of his scholars respecting the sale of his Bibles. His feelings were much hurt, apparently. He made some remarks concerning it to each class. At noon he called on the school committee, his feelings much depressed. We gave him all the satisfaction we could in righteousness, and his feelings were measurably allayed.</p>
<p>This evening the several quorums met agreeable to adjournment, and were organized according to their official standing in the Church. I then arose and made some remarks on the object of our meeting, as follows:</p>
<p>First--To receive or reject certain resolutions that were drafted by a committee chosen for that purpose, at a preceding meeting, respecting licenses for Elders and other official members.</p>
<p>Second--To sanction, by the united voice of the quorums, certain resolutions respecting ordaining members that have passed through each quorum separately, without any alteration or amendment, excepting in the quorum of the Twelve.</p>
<p><strong>Final Action on Resolutions on Ordinations and Licenses.</strong></p>
<p>After singing and prayer, President Oliver Cowdery, chairman of the committee appointed on the 24th ultimo, to draft resolutions respecting licenses, arose and made report in behalf of the committee, which was read three times by the chairman. The third time he read the resolutions he gave time and opportunity, after reading each article, for objections to be made, if any there were. No objections were raised, or alterations made, but an addition was made to the sixth article extending the powers of the chairman and clerk <em>pro tem.</em> to sign licenses, etc.</p>
<p><a name="403" id="403"></a>[Page 403]</p>
<p>I then observed that these resolutions must needs pass through each quorum separately, beginning at the presidency of each quorum, and consequently it must first be thrown into the hands of the president of the Deacons and his council, as equal rights and privileges is my motto; and one man is as good as another, if he behaves as well; and that all men should be esteemed alike, without regard to distinctions of an official nature. The resolutions were passed by the president of the Deacons and his council by unanimous voice.</p>
<p>It was then presented before the presidents of the several quorums and their counselors in the following order, and in the same manner as before, viz: the Teachers, Priests, Bishop of Kirtland, Bishop of Zion, Elders, High Priests, Seventy, High Council of Zion, High Council of Kirtland, the Twelve, and, lastly, passed into the hands of the Presidency of the Church, and all the quorums, and received their unanimous sanction. The resolutions are as follows:</p>
<p>Resolutions on Ordinations and Licenses.</p>
<p>Whereas, the records of the several conferences held by the Elders of the Church, and the ordination of many of the official members of the same, in many cases, have been imperfectly kept since its organization. to avoid ever after any inconvenience, difficulty or injury, in consequence of such neglect, your committee recommend:</p>
<p>First--That all licenses hereafter granted by these authorities assembled as a quorum, or by general conference held for the purpose of transacting the business of the Church, be recorded at full length by the clerk appointed for that purpose, in a book to be kept in this branch of the Church, until it shall be thought advisable by the heads of the Church to order other books and appoint other clerks, to record licenses as above; and that said recording clerk be required to indorse a certificate under his own hand and signature, on the back of said licenses, specifying the time when, and place where, such license was recorded, and also a reference to the letter and page of the book containing the same.</p>
<p><a name="404" id="404"></a>[Page 404]</p>
<p>Second--That this quorum appoint two persons to sign licenses given as aforesaid, one as chairman, and the other as clerk of conference; and that it shall be the duty of said persons appointed to sign licenses as clerk of conference immediately hereafter, to deliver the same into the hands of the recording clerk.</p>
<p>Third--That all general conferences abroad give each individual whom they ordain, a certificate, signed by the chairman and clerk of said conference, stating the time and place of such conference, and the office to which the individual has been ordained; and that when such certificate has been forwarded to the person hereafter authorized to sign licenses as clerk of conference, such person shall, together with chairman of conference, immediately sign a license; and said clerk of conference shall, after the same has been recorded, forward to the proper person.</p>
<p>Fourth--That all official members in good standing and fellowship in the various branches of this Church, be requested to forward their present licenses, accompanied by a certificate of their virtuous and faithful walk before the Lord, signed by the chairman and clerk of a general conference, or by the clerk of a branch of the Church in which such official member resides, by the advice and direction of such Church, to the clerk of conference, whose duty it shall be to fill a new license, as directed in the third article; and that all licenses, signed, recorded, and endorsed, as specified in the first article, shall be considered good, and valid to all intents and purposes, in the business and spiritual affairs of this Church, as a religions society, or before any court of record of this or any other country, wherein preachers of the Gospel are entitled to special privileges, answering in all respects as an original record, without the necessity of referring to any other document.</p>
<p>Fifth--That the recording clerk be required to publish quarterly a paper published by some member or members of this Church, a list of the names of the several persons for whom he has recorded licenses within the last quarter of a year.</p>
<p>Sixth--That this quorum appoint two persons to sign licenses as chairman and clerk of conference <em>pro tem.</em> for the standing chairman and clerk, who shall be appointed as named in the second article, and also to act in their absence, in signing other licenses, as specified in the foregoing article.</p>
<p>President Joseph Smith, Jun., was nominated as chairman, Frederick G. Williams, as clerk, and Sidney Rigdon as chairman <em>pro tem </em>and Oliver Cowdery as clerk <em>pro tem.</em> Vote from the several quorums called, in their order, and passed unanimously.</p>
<p>President Joseph Smith, Jun., made some remarks upon the resolution offered to the Council on the 12th of February. Followed by President Thomas B. Marsh, who called a vote of his quorum to ascertain whether they would repeal their amendment of the 13th of February. And nine of the Twelve voted in the affirmative, and three, viz., John F. Boynton, Lyman E. Johnson, and Orson Pratt, in the negative. And the original resolution of the 12th of February was passed.</p>

<p>Dismissed by prayer, half-past nine o'clock.</p>
<p>Oliver Cowdery, Clerk.</p>
<p><em>Friday, 4.</em>--Attended school as usual. The sleighing is failing fast, the icy chains of winter seem to be giving way under the influence of the returning sun, and spring will soon open to us with all its charms.</p>
<p><strong>The Board Kiln Again Fired.</strong></p>
<p><em>Saturday, 5.</em>--Attended school. In the afternoon the board kiln took fire and the lumber was principally consumed. To the best of my recollection this is the fifth or sixth time it has burned this winter.</p>
<p><em>Sunday, 6</em>--Spent the day at home in the enjoyment of the society of my family, around the social fireside.</p>
<p><em>Monday, 7.</em>--Spent the day in attending to my studies. At the evening, met with my class at Professor Seixas' room and translated the 17th chapter of Genesis.</p>
<p>After the class was dismissed I was requested to tarry, with the rest of the committee, to make some arrangements about paying Mr. Seixas for his instruction, and to engage him for another quarter. We did not arrive at anything definite upon the point. However, Mr. Seixas has agreed to teach us three weeks longer, and perhaps a quarter, after having a vacation of two weeks, at the expiration of the present course.</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 8.</em>--Attended school and translated most of the 22nd chapter of Genesis. After my class was dismissed, retired to the printing office and translated ten verses of the 3rd of Exodus, which, with the first and second Psalms, are our next lesson.</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 9.</em>--Attended school as usual.</p>
<p><em>Thursday, 10.</em>--Attended school in the morning</p>

<p>At evening went down to the Professor's room, to be instructed by him in the language. On account of the storm the class did not meet.</p>
<p><strong>Further Arrangements of Hebrew Classes.</strong></p>
<p><em>Friday, 11.</em>--Met with the morning class at nine o'clock. At ten, went into the office and made a division of our class for private studies, for our better accommodation and advancement in the language we are studying.</p>
<p>Presidents Rigdon, Phelps, and Cowdery, met at the printing office; Elders Orson Pratt, Sylvester Smith, and Bishop Partridge, at Luke S. Johnson's; Elders M'Lellin, Orson Hyde, and Warren Parrish, on the Flats.</p>
<p>This evening our class met at Mr. Seixas' room and spent an hour in our studies. Class dismissed and retired, except the school committee, who tarried and made some arrangements with Mr. Seixas about continuing longer with us and bringing his family to this place. This has been a very stormy day, and the snow is still falling fast, and the prospect is fair for another run of sleighing, which is uncommon for this country at this season of the year.</p>
<p><strong>The Prophet's Reflection on Intemperance</strong></p>
<p><em>Saturday, 12.</em>--Engaged a team to go to Hudson after Mr. Seixas' family and goods, also a horse and carriage for himself and wife. Cold weather and fine sleighing. I was informed today that a man by the name of Clark, who was under the influence of ardent spirits froze to death last night, near this place. How long, O Lord, will this monster intemperance find its victims on the earth! I fear until the earth is swept with the wrath and indignation of God, and Christ's kingdom becomes universal. O, come, Lord Jesus, and cut short Thy work in righteousness.</p>
<p>Elder Solomon Hancock received a letter from Missouri bearing the painful intelligence of the death of his wife. May the Lord bless him and comfort him in this hour of affliction.</p>
<p><strong>Removal of the Presidency and Twelve to Zion Contemplated.</strong></p>
<p><em>Sunday, 13.</em>--Met with the Presidency and some of the Twelve, and counseled with them upon the subject of removing to Zion this spring. We conversed freely upon the importance of her redemption, the necessity of the Presidency removing to that place, that their influence might be more effectually used in gathering the Saints to that country; and we finally resolved to emigrate on or before the 15th of May next, if kind Providence smiles upon us and opens the way before us.</p>

<p>Chapter 28</p>
<p><a name="fn-1" id="fn-1"></a>1. Elder Brigham Young, it should be remembered, in the town of Aurelius, Cayuga County, New York, had for twelve years followed the occupation of carpenter, joiner, painter and glazier. (See Life of Brigham Young, Tullidge, p. 77). Hence this appointment to supervise the work mentioned.</p>
<p><a name="fn-2" id="fn-2"></a>2. "The Temple was so constructed that with white canvas curtains that could be dropped and raised at pleasure, the lower story was, whenever occasion required, divided into four sections or compartments. * * * * The two sets of pulpits, one on the east and the other to the west end of the building were intersected by the curtains extending from east to west, so as to leave half their lengths in each apartment, and they were occupied by the presiding officers who directed the services. Thus four separate meetings could be in session at the same time without in the least interfering with each other, giving opportunity for four to exercise instead of one."--(Eliza R. Snow, Autobiography and Family Record of Lorenzo Snow, p. 12). It was upon these canvas curtains or "veils" that the sisters were at work as stated in the text.</p>
