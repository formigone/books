<p><strong>Bishop's Agent Appointed.</strong></p>
<p>At a conference of the authorities of the Church and the Saints in the House of the Lord at Kirtland, September 17th, Bishop Newel K. Whitney said the time had arrived when it became necessary for him to travel, and necessarily he must leave an agent to act in his absence agreeable to the provisions made in the revelations. He nominated William Marks, who was elected agent to the Bishop by unanimous vote.</p>
<p><strong>The Church Recorder.</strong></p>
<p>George W. Robinson was unanimously elected general Church recorder in place of Oliver Cowdery, who had removed to Missouri.</p>
<p><strong>The Bishop's Memorial.</strong></p>
<p>After taking into consideration the situation of Zion and the Church in general, the conference decided that it was of great importance to the cause of truth in general, and the prosperity of the work, that the Bishop and his counselors send abroad their memorial to all the Saints throughout the land, as well as to all well-wishers to the cause of Zion, and that their appeal go forth in the name and by the authority of the Church to all the Saints scattered abroad.</p>
<p><strong>The Prophet on the Gathering.</strong></p>
<p>The same evening the Elders assembled in conference in the House of the Lord when I addressed them on the subject of the gathering of the Saints in the last days, and the duties of the different quorums in relation thereto.</p>
<p><a name="514" id="514"></a>[Page 514]</p>
<p><strong>Other Stakes of Zion to be Appointed.</strong></p>
<p>It appeared manifest to the conference that the places appointed for the gathering of the Saints were at this time crowded to overflowing, and that it was necessary that there be more stakes of Zion appointed in order that the poor might have a place to gather to, "wherefore it was moved, seconded and voted unanimously that President Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon be requested by this conference to go and appoint other stakes, or places of gathering, and that they receive a certificate of their appointment, signed by the clerk of the Church."</p>
<p><strong>Arrangements for Preaching the Gospel.</strong></p>
<p>Elder William Marks, who had previously been appointed agent to the Bishop, being called upon arose and said that he would comply with the request of the Church, and the Lord being his helper he would discharge the duties of his office to the best of his ability. After which the Elders present who were in a situation to travel were called upon to number themselves, and there were numbered one hundred and nine, and they were divided into eight companies in the following order--number one to thirteen, called the first company, were appointed to travel east; No. 14 to 26, were to travel southeast; No. 27 to 39, south; No. 40 to 52, southwest; No. 53 to 65, west; No. 66 to 78, northwest; No. 79 to 91, north; No. 92 to 104, northeast. Five being left after this division, No. 105 was appointed to travel with the company going southeast; No. 106, with the company northwest; 107, south; 108, east; 109, with the north company. It was further appointed that those who might desire to travel a different course from the one which was appointed to the division to which they belonged, might have the privilege of changing with those of another division. And lastly it was appointed that the different divisions hold their own meetings, to make such arrangements as they should think proper in relation to their journeying.</p>
<p>Agreeable to the vote of the conference on the 17th, Bishop Whitney and counselors issued the memorial as follows :</p>
<p><a name="515" id="515"></a>[Page 515]</p>
<p>Kirtland, Ohio, September 18th, 1837.</p>
<p>To the Saints Scattered Abroad, the Bishop of Kirtland and his Counselors send Greeting:</p>
<p>Whereas the Church in Kirtland has taken into consideration the affairs of the Latter-day Saints in general, having opportunities of making themselves acquainted with the situation of the Saints throughout the continent, and the very flattering prospects of the prosperity of the cause of God in our land, and also of the peculiar condition of the city of Kirtland, which is a kind of first fruits of the cities which the Lord has begun to build unto Himself in these last days, it has been deemed of great importance to the prosperity of the cause of truth in general, that the Bishop and his counselors send abroad this their memorial to all the Saints throughout the land, as well as to all well wishers to the cause of Zion in this our most happy country.</p>
<p>It is a fact well known that the Saints in the city of Kirtland have been called to endure great affliction for the truth's sake, and to bear a heavy burden in order that the foundation of the kingdom of God might be laid on a sure and certain basis, so that the prophetic vision of Daniel might most certainly be fulfilled, that this kingdom might break in pieces all other kingdoms and stand for ever. The exertions of the enemy to prevent this have been very great; and through their great exertions they have given to the Saints great trouble, and caused them much expense. In addition to this, they have had to publish the word of the Lord, which has been attended with great expense. These things, together with building the House of the Lord, have embarrassed them very much; for when subscriptions failed they went on and accomplished the work of building the house themselves, plighting all that they had, property, credit, and reputation, and by these means accomplished this great work which is the wonder and admiration of the world. This they have done in faith, believing that, as the multitude of Saints increased, their liberality would abound towards those who, regarding nothing but the salvation of the world, have thus exposed themselves to financial ruin in order that the work of the gathering might not fail. And besides all this there have been a large number of poor who have had to receive assistance from the donations of the Church, which have tended to increase its embarrassments; and now so numerous are the Saints grown that it is impracticable for them all to gather to the places which are now appointed for this purpose.</p>
<p><a name="516" id="516"></a>[Page 516]</p>
<p>The Church at Kirtland has, therefore, required at the hand of our beloved brethren, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon, men who have not thought their lives dear unto them in order that the cause of God might be established, presidents whom God has appointed to preside over the whole Church, and the persons to whom this work belongs, that they should go forth and lay off other stakes of Zion, or places of gathering, so that the poor may have a place of refuge, or places of refuge, in the day of tribulation which is coming swiftly on the earth. All these things will be attended with expense. Feeling ourselves under great responsibility by virtue of our office and calling in the Church of God, we present this our memorial to all the Saints, making a most solemn appeal to the feelings, benevolence and philanthropy of all the Saints into whose hands this our memorial comes, in faith and confidence that this appeal will not be made in vain.</p>
<p>It is the fixed purpose of our God, and has been so from the beginning as appears by the testimony of the ancient Prophets, that the great work of the last days was to be accomplished by the tithing of His Saints. The Saints were required to bring their tithes into the store house, and after that, not before, they were to look for a blessing that there should not be room enough to receive it. (See <a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/mal/3.10?lang=eng#9" target="_blank">Malachi 3rd chapter, 10th verse</a>). Our appeal, then, to the Saints is founded on the best of testimony, that which no Saint will feel to gainsay, but rejoice to obey. The Saints of God will rejoice in all that the Lord does, and in doing all that the Lord requires. The sacrifice of righteousness which the Lord requires will be offered with a willing heart and ready mind, and with great joy, because they are accounted worthy to offer up sacrifice for His name.</p>
<p>In making this appeal to the benevolence of the Saints of God we do not only take into consideration the situation of the poor, the embarrassments of the stake of Kirtland, but also their own interests, for every Saint has an equal interest in building up the Zion of our God, for it is after the Lord has built up Zion that He will appear in His glory (<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ps/102.16?lang=eng#15" target="_blank">Psalm 102:16</a>). We all look for the appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ, but we shall look in vain until Zion is built, for Zion is to be the dwelling place of our God when He comes (<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/joel/3.21?lang=eng#20" target="_blank">Joel 3:21</a>). Anyone who will read this chapter with attention will see that it treats of the last days, and of the Zion of the last days. How, then, is the Lord to dwell in Zion if Zion be not built up? This question we leave the Saints to answer. The salvation of the Saints one and all depends on the building up of Zion, for without this there is no salvation, for deliverance in the last days is found in Zion and in Jerusalem, and in the remnant whom the Lord our God shall call, or in other words, in the stakes which He shall appoint (<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/joel/2.32?lang=eng#31" target="_blank">Joel 2:32</a>). It is in Zion where the Lord is to create upon every dwelling place and upon her assemblies a cloud of smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night. It is upon the glory of Zion that there will be a defense. It is in Zion that there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from the heat, and for a place of refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain (<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/4.5-6?lang=eng#4" target="_blank">Isaiah 4:5-6</a>). It is upon the walls of Zion where the watchmen shall see eye to eye (<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/3.8?lang=eng#7" target="_blank">Isaiah 3:8</a>).</p>
<p><a name="517" id="517"></a>[Page 517]</p>
<p>Whatever is glorious, whatever is desirable, whatever pertains to salvation, either temporal or spiritual, our hopes, our expectations, our glory, and our reward, all depend on our building up Zion according to the testimony of the Prophets, for unless Zion is built our hopes perish, our expectations fail, our prospects are blasted, our salvation withers, and God will come and smite the whole earth with a curse. Hear, then, O ye Saints of the last days! And let this our appeal have a favorable reception among you. Let every Saint consider well the nature of his calling in the last days, and the great responsibility which rests upon him or her, as one to whom God has revealed His will; and make haste not only to the relief of Kirtland, but also to the building up of Zion. Let every man and every woman give heed the very instant that they embrace the Gospel, and exert themselves with energy to send on means to build up Zion, for our God bids us to hasten the building of the city, saying the time has come when the city must be pushed forward with unceasing exertions, for behold, the day of calamity draweth nigh, and unless the Saints hasten the building of the city they will not escape.</p>
<p>Be admonished, then, O ye Saints! And let not covetousness, which is idolatry, nor worldly ambition hinder you; but gather up your gold and your silver and all the means you have and send on to the Saints who are engaged in this great work of building the Zion of God, that there may be a place of refuge for you and for your children in the day of God's vengeance, when He shall come down on Idumea, or the world, in His fury and stamp them down in His wrath, and none shall escape but the inhabitants of Zion. What we say unto one we say unto all, haste, haste, and delay not! for the hour of desolation does not linger, and with all the power that the Saints have, and with all the diligence they can use they will scarcely escape.</p>
<p>The time is not far distant when some of those who now deride and mock the Saints for devoting their all to build up the Zion of God, will bless their name for having provided a city of refuge for them and their children, regardless of the ravings of ungodly priests, and the mockings of a stupid and ignorant people. In the confidence which we have in the good sense and righteous principles of the multitude of the Saints, we send this our memorial in the name of our Master, Jesus, believing that this appeal will be received with great kindness, and will be attended to with untiring perseverance until the object for which it has been sent shall be accomplished. And may the God of all grace pour out His richest blessings on your heads, and crown you with abundance, that the Zion of our God may flourish and cease not until the righteousness thereof shall go forth as the light and the salvation thereof as a lamp which burneth, is the prayer of your brethren in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>Minutes of a High Council at Kirtland.</p>
<p>Kirtland, November 20th. The High Council met in the Lord's House, John Smith presiding.</p>
<p>Reuben Hedlock preferred the following charge against Zenos H. Brewster, Jane Brewster, Collins Brewster, D. H. Dustin and wife, Moses R. Norris and wife, Eliza Norris, Samuel Barnet, Jemima Butler, Osman M. Duel,--Butler, and Roxanna Repsher, for giving heed to revelations said to be translated from the Book of Moroni by Collins Brewster, and for entering into a written covenant different from the articles and covenants of the Church of Latter-day Saints, and following a vain and delusive spirit.</p>
<p>Two were appointed to speak on each side.</p>
<p>The writings and revelations kept and received by the accused were presented, and read by the clerk of the Council.</p>
<p>The accused pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>Brother Felshaw was called forward by the plaintiff, who stated that he had visited the accused and labored with them according to the law of the Church; that the accused justified themselves, seeing the Church had not lived according to the former revelations, and they considered the High Council and others were in transgression; and that most of the accused appeared to be determined to pursue their own way, whether right or wrong.</p>
<p><a name="526" id="526"></a>[Page 526]</p>
<p>Brother Allen said the accused appeared to manifest a hard spirit against the Presidents of the Church and the High Council.</p>
<p>Brother Dunn concurred.</p>
<p>Brother Sawyer stated that he heard Brother Norris say that those in authority were against him and if he could not establish an order of things here to his mind he would go out among the Gentiles and do it.</p>
<p>Brother Knight confirmed the foregoing testimony.</p>
<p>The accused called Brother Freeman, who stated that he had attended a number of the meetings of the accused and saw nothing out of the way.</p>
<p>Brother E. Strong confirmed Brother Freeman's statement, but did not know when he attended the meetings at which they received revelations for themselves.</p>
<p>Brother J. Foster agreed with the last two witnesses. Brother Preston was called by the accuser, who testified that the accused refused to admit him into their meetings and that others were rejected</p>
<p>Several witnesses testified that they attended their meetings and saw nothing wrong.</p>
<p>Others testified they had heard them speak against the heads of the Church and that Brother Joseph had many things to repent of, and one of them said he thought some put too much stress on the Priesthood, and that he was informed that Brother Norris laid his hands on Collins Brewster and ordained him a prophet, and that one of the accused said he was determined to pursue his own course whether it suited the High Council or not.</p>
<p>After the pleas of his councilors the accused spoke in justification of their course generally, when the Council decided that the charge had been fully sustained and withdrew fellowship from those who persisted in their course of conduct as before mentioned.</p>

<p><strong>Excommunication of Rodger Orton.</strong></p>
<p><em>November 30.</em>--Daniel S. Miles presented a complaint against Roger Orton "for abusing Elder Brigham Young and for a general course of unchristianlike conduct." The accused having been notified to appear and answer for his conduct, and having refused, the High Council decided that he be cut off, for showing contempt to the authorities of the Church.</p>

<p><strong>Apostasy in Kirtland.</strong></p>
<p>I returned to Kirtland on or about the 10th of December. During my absence in Missouri Warren Parrish, John F. Boynton, Luke S. Johnson, Joseph Coe, and some others united together for the overthrow of the Church. Soon after my return this dissenting band openly and publicly renounced the Church of Christ of Latter-day Saints and claimed themselves to be the old standard, calling themselves the Church of Christ, excluding the word "Saints," and set me at naught, and the whole Church, denouncing us as heretics, not considering that the Saints shall possess the kingdom according to the Prophet Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>Last Paper Printed in Kirtland.</strong></p>
<p>TheÂ <em>Elders' Journal</em>Â No. 2 for November was the last paper printed at Kirtland. Our printing establishment was attached to satisfy an unjust judgment of the county court, and soon after the whole printing apparatus and office were burned to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>The Work in England.</strong></p>
<p>The work began to spread in England with great rapidity. On the 12th of September Elder Goodson left Bedford for Preston, and about the 1st of October sailed for America, in company with Brother Snyder, taking with him two hundred Books of Mormon, which the Elders in vain tried to persuade him to leave. Branches were established in Eccleston, Wrightington, Heskin, Euxton Bath, Daubers Lane, Chorley, Whittle, Leyland Moss, Ribchester, Thornley, Clithero, Waddington, Downham, and other places round about Preston, where the brethren hired the "Cock Pit," a large and convenient building for preaching, but, being disturbed by some Methodist priests, were obliged to have the house licensed by the civil courts, according to the statutes of the realm, which, with the aid of two constables who voluntarily proffered their services, restored peace and order. And on Christmas day, December 25th, Elders Kimball and Hyde, and Joseph Fielding (who had previously been ordained an Elder) assembled in the "Cock Pit" with about three hundred Saints, several of whom were ordained to the lesser Priesthood, fourteen were confirmed, and about one hundred children were blessed by the Elders. This was the first public conference of the Church in England, and at this conference the Word of Wisdom was first publicly taught in that country.</p>

<p><strong>Progress of the British Mission.</strong></p>
<p>While the work was thus rapidly progressing in Lancashire it continued gradually to progress at Bedford, also a branch was established at Bassynburn, and another at Peter's Green, by Elder Richards.</p>
<p><strong>Flight of Brigham Young from Kirtland.</strong></p>
<p>On the morning of the 22nd of December, 1837, Brother Brigham Young left Kirtland in consequence of the fury of the mob spirit that prevailed in the apostates who had threatened to destroy him because he would proclaim publicly and privately that he knew by the power of the Holy Ghost that I was a Prophet of the Most High God, that I had not transgressed and fallen as the apostates declared.</p>
<p><strong>Close of the Year 1837.</strong></p>
<p>Apostasy, persecution, confusion, and mobocracy strove hard to bear rule at Kirtland, and thus closed the year 1837.</p>
<p>End of Vol. 2.</p>
<p>Chapter 36</p>
<p><a name="fn-1" id="fn-1"></a>1. The above named publication, "A Voice of Warning and Instruction to all People," is the first argumentative and doctrinal work published by any of the Elders; and it is no disparagement of other works to say that this pioneer book of its class is not only the first in the matter of time when issued, but first also in excellence. It has been a most successful missionary; and thousands have been brought to a conviction of the truth through reading its pages. The first edition--three thousand copies--sold in about two years. A second edition--two thousand five hundred copies--was issued; and such was the increase in the demand for it that by 1846, the author could congratulate himself upon having seen it pass through five editions. During more than half a century since then "The Voice of Warning" has passed through many editions in English, and has been translated into seven foreign languages, and in a number of these several editions have been issued. The author, of honored memory, is to be congratulated upon the attainment of his fondest hopes respecting this work, as so prophetically expressed in the preface of the first European edition: "And should the author be called to sacrifice his life for theÂ <em>Truth,</em>Â he will have the consolation that it will be said of him, as it was of Abel--<em>'He being dead, yet speaketh.</em>' "</p>
