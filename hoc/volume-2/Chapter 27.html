<p>Reconciliation of the First Presidency and Twelve Apostles--Pentecostal Times in Kirtland.</p>
<p><a name="372" id="372"></a>[Page 372]</p>
<p><em>Saturday, 16.</em>--By request I met with the Council of the Twelve in company with my Counselors, Frederick G. Williams and Sidney Rigdon.</p>
<p>Special Council Meeting with the Twelve.</p>
<p>Council opened with singing, and prayer by Thomas B. Marsh, President of the Twelve. He arose and requested the privilege, in behalf of his colleagues, of each speaking in his turn without being interrupted; which was granted them.</p>
<p>Elder Marsh proceeded to unbosom his feelings touching the mission of the Twelve, and more particularly respecting a certain letter which they received from the Presidency of the High Council in Kirtland, while attending a conference in the state of Maine; also spoke of being placed, in the council on Friday last, below the Councils of Kirtland and Zion, having been previously placed next the Presidency in our assemblies; also observed that they were hurt on account of some remarks made by President Hyrum Smith, on the trial of Gladden Bishop, (who had been previously tried before the Council of the Twelve, while on their mission in the east,) who had by their request, thrown his case before the High Council in Kirtland, for investigation; and the Twelve considered that their proceedings with him, were in some degree discountenanced.</p>
<p>Elder Marsh then gave way to his brethren, and they arose and spoke in turn until they had all spoken, acquiescing in the observations of Elder Marsh, and made some additions to his remarks, which, in substance, were as follows: That the letter in question, which they received from the Presidency, in which two of their members were suspended, and the rest severely chastened, and that, too, upon testimony which was unwarranted; and particular stress was laid upon a certain letter which the Presidency had received from Dr. Warren E. Cowdery, of Freedom, New York, in which he preferred charges against them, which were false, and upon which the Presidency had acted in chastening them; and therefore the Twelve had concluded that the Presidency had lost confidence in them; and that whereas, the Church in this place had caressed them at the time of their appointment to the Apostleship, they now treated them coolly, and also appeared to have lost confidence in them.</p>
<p><a name="373" id="373"></a>[Page 373]</p>
<p>They spoke of their having been in the work from the beginning almost, and had borne the burden in the heat of the day, and passed through many trials, and that the Presidency ought not to suspect their fidelity, nor lose confidence in them, neither ought they to have chastened them upon such testimony as was lying before them; also urged the necessity of an explanation upon the letter which they received from the Presidency, and the propriety of their having information respecting their duties, authority, etc., that they might come to an understanding in all things, that they might act in perfect unison and harmony before the Lord, and be prepared for the endowment; also that they had preferred a charge against Doctor Cowdery, for his unchristian conduct, which the Presidency had disregarded; also that President Oliver Cowdery, on a certain occasion, had made use of language to one of the Twelve that was unchristian and unbecoming any man; and that they would not submit to such treatment. The remarks of the Twelve were made in a very forcible and explicit manner, yet cool and deliberate.</p>
<p>President Smith observed that the Presidency had heard them patiently, and, in turn, should expect to be heard patiently also. And first, he remarked that it was necessary that the Twelve should state whether they were determined to persevere in the work of the Lord, whether the Presidency were able to satisfy them or not.</p>
<p>Vote called, and carried in the affirmative, unanimously.</p>
<p>President Smith then said to the Twelve that he had not lost confidence in them; they had no reason to suspect his confidence; and that he would be willing to be weighed in the scale of truth, today, in this matter, and risk it in the day of judgment. Respecting the chastening contained in the letter in question, which he acknowledged might have been expressed in too harsh language, which was not intentional, he asked their forgiveness, inasmuch as he had hurt their feelings; but nevertheless, the letter that Elder M'Lellin wrote back to Kirtland, while the Twelve were in the east, was harsh also, and he was willing to set the one against the other.</p>
<p>President Smith next proceeded to explain the duty of the Twelve, and their authority, which is next to the present Presidency, and that the arrangement of the assembly in this place, on the 15th instant, in placing the High Councils of Kirtland next the Presidency, was because the business to be transacted, was business relating to that body in particular, which was to fill the several quorums in Kirtland, not because they were first in office, and that the arrangements were the most judicious that could be made on the occasion; also the Twelve are not subject to any other than the first Presidency, viz., "myself," said the Prophet, "Sidney Rigdon, and Frederick G. Williams, who are now my Counselors; and where I am not, there is no First Presidency over the Twelve."</p>
<p><a name="374" id="374"></a>[Page 374]</p>
<p>The Prophet also stated to the Twelve that he did not countenance the harsh language of President Cowdery to them, neither would he countenance it in himself nor in any other man, "although," said he, "I have sometimes spoken too harshly from the impulse of the moment, and inasmuch as I have wounded your feelings, brethren, I ask your forgiveness, for I love you and will hold you up with all my heart in all righteousness, before the Lord, and before all men; for be assured, brethren, I am willing to stem the torrent of all opposition, in storms and in tempests, in thunders and in lightnings, by sea and by land, in the wilderness or among false brethren, or mobs, or wherever God in His providence may call us. And I am determined that neither heights nor depths, principalities nor powers, things present or things to come, or any other creature, shall separate me from you. And I will now covenant with you before God, that I will not listen to or credit any derogatory report against any of you, nor condemn you upon any testimony beneath the heavens, short of that testimony which is infallible, until I can see you face to face, and know of a surety; and I do place unremitted confidence in your word, for I believe you to be men of truth. And I ask the same of you, when I tell you anything, that you place equal confidence in my word, for I will not tell you I know anything that I do not know. But I have already consumed more time than I intended when I commenced, and I will now give way to my colleagues."</p>
<p>President Rigdon arose next and acquiesced in what President Smith had said, and acknowledged to the Twelve that he had not done as he ought, in not citing Dr. Warren A. Cowdery to trial on the charges that were put into his hands by the Twelve; that he neglected his duty in this thing, for which he asked their forgiveness, and would now attend to it, if they desired him to do so; <a class="footnote" href="#fn-1">1</a> and President Rigdon also observed to the Twelve, if he had spoken or reproved too harshly at any time, and had injured their feelings by so doing, he asked their forgiveness.</p>
<p><a name="375" id="375"></a>[Page 375]</p>
<p>President Williams arose and acquiesced in the above sentiments, expressed by the Prophet and President Rigdon, in full, and said many good things.</p>
<p>The President of the Twelve then called a vote of that body, to know whether they were perfectly satisfied with the explanations given them, and whether they would enter into the covenant the Presidency had proposed to them, which was most readily manifested in the affirmative, by raising their hands to heaven in testimony of their willingness and desire to enter into this covenant, and their entire satisfaction with the explanation upon all the difficulties that were on their minds. The brethren then took each other by the hand in confirmation of the covenant, and there was a perfect union of feeling on this occasion, and the hearts of all overflowed with blessings, which the brethren pronounced upon one another's heads as the Spirit gave them utterance.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Prophet said: "My scribe is included in that covenant, and these blessings with us, for I love him for the truth and integrity that dwell in him. And may God enable us to perform our vows and covenants with each other, in all fidelity and righteousness before Him, that our influence may be felt among the nations of the earth, in mighty power, even to rend the kingdoms of darkness asunder, and triumph over priestcraft and spiritual wickedness in high places, and break in pieces all kingdoms that are opposed to the kingdom of Christ, and spread the light and truth of the everlasting Gospel from the rivers to the ends of the earth."</p>
<p>Elder Beaman came in for counsel, to know whether it was best for him to return before the solemn assembly or not. After consideration, the Council advised him to tarry.</p>
<p>Council dismissed by singing and prayer.</p>

<p><strong>Testimonies of Presidency and Twelve.</strong></p>
<p><em>Sunday, 17.</em>--Attended meeting at the school house at the usual hour; a large congregation assembled. I proceeded to arrange the several quorums present, first the Presidency, then the Twelve, and the Seventy who were present, also the Councilors of Kirtland and Zion.</p>
<p><a name="376" id="376"></a>[Page 376]</p>
<p>President Rigdon then arose and observed that instead of preaching the time would be occupied by the Presidency and Twelve, in speaking each in his turn until they had all spoken. The Lord poured out His Spirit upon us, and the brethren began to confess their faults one to the other, and the congregation was soon overwhelmed in tears, and some of our hearts were too big for utterance. The gift of tongues came on us also, like the rushing of a mighty wind, and my soul was filled with the glory of God.</p>
<p><strong>Marriage and Sacrament.</strong></p>
<p>In the afternoon I joined three couple in matrimony, in the public congregation, viz: William F. Cahoon and Maranda Gibbs, Harvey Stanley and Larona Cahoon, Tunis Rapley and Louisa Cutler. We then administered the Sacrament, and dismissed the congregation, which was so large that it was very unpleasant for all. We were then invited to a feast at Elder Cahoon's which was prepared for the occasion, and had a good time while partaking of the rich repast; and I verily realized that it was good for brethren to dwell together in unity, like the dew upon the mountains of Israel, where the Lord commanded blessings, even life forevermore. Spent the evening at home.</p>
<p><em>Monday, 18.</em>--Attended the Hebrew school. This day the Elders' school was removed into the Temple, in the room adjoining the Hebrew school.</p>
<p><strong>Progress in Study of Hebrew.</strong></p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 19.</em>--Spent the day at school. The Lord blessed us in our studies. This day we commenced reading in our Hebrew Bibles with much success. It seems as if the Lord opens our minds in a marvelous manner, to understand His word in the original language; and my prayer is that God will speedily endow us with a knowledge of all languages and tongues, that His servants may go forth for the last time the better prepared to bind up the law, and seal up the testimony.</p>
<p><a name="377" id="377"></a>[Page 377]</p>
<p>Form of Marriage Certificate.</p>
<p>I hereby certify, that, agreeable to the rules and regulations of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, on matrimony, Mr. William F. Cahoon and Miss Nancy M. Gibbs, both of this place, were joined in marriage, on Sabbath, the 17th, instant.</p>
<p>Joseph Smith, Jun.,</p>
<p>Presiding Elder of said Church.</p>
<p>Kirtland, Ohio, January 19th, 1836.</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 20.</em>--Attended school at the usual hour, and spent the day in reading and lecturing, and made some advancement in our studies.</p>
<p>In the evening I attended a matrimonial occasion with my family, at Mr. John Johnson's, having been invited to join Elder John F. Boynton and Miss Susan Lowell in marriage; a large and respectable company assembled, and were seated by Elders Orson Hyde and Warren Parrish, in the following order--The Presidency and their companions in the first seats, the Twelve Apostles in the second, the Seventy in the third, and the remainder of the congregation seated with their companions. Elder Boynton and lady, with their attendants, came in and were seated in front of the Presidency.</p>
<p><strong>Marriage of J. F. Boynton.</strong></p>
<p>A hymn was sung, after which I addressed the throne of grace. I then arose and read aloud a license, (according to the law of the land) granting any minister of the Gospel the privilege of solemnizing the rights of matrimony, and after calling for objection, if any there were, against the anticipated alliance between Elder Boynton and Miss Lowell; after waiting a sufficient time and hearing no objection, I observed that all forever after this must hold their peace. I then invited them to join hands. I pronounced the ceremony, according to the rules and regulations of the Church of the Latter-day Saints, in the name of God, and in the name of Jesus Christ. I pronounced upon them the blessings of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and such other blessings as the Lord put into my heart; and being much under the influence of a cold, I then gave way, and President Rigdon arose and delivered a very forcible address, suited to the occasion, and closed the services of the evening by prayer.</p>
<p><a name="378" id="378"></a>[Page 378]</p>
<p><strong>The Marriage Feast.</strong></p>
<p>Elders Orson Hyde, Luke S. Johnson, and Warren Parrish, then presented the Presidency with three servers of glasses filled with wine, to bless. And it fell to my lot to attend to this duty which I cheerfully discharged. It was then passed round in order, then the cake in the same order; and suffice it to say, our hearts were made glad while partaking of the bounty of earth which was presented, until we had taken our fill; and joy filled every bosom, and the countenances of old and young seemed to bloom alike with cheerfulness and smiles of youth; and an entire unison of feeling seemed to pervade the congregation, and indeed I doubt whether the pages of history can boast of a more splendid and innocent wedding and feast than this, for it was conducted after the order of heaven, which has a time for all things; and this being a time of rejoicing, we heartily embraced it and conducted ourselves accordingly. Took leave of the company and returned home.</p>
<p><strong>J. W. Olived and the Prophet.</strong></p>
<p><em>Thursday, 21.</em>--This morning, a minister from Connecticut, by the name of John W. Olived, called at my house and inquired of my father: "Does the Prophet live here?" My father replied he did not understand him. Mr. Olived asked the same question again and again, and received the same answer. He finally asked: "Does Mr. Smith live here?" Father replied: "O yes, sir, I understand you now." Father then stepped into my room and informed me that a gentleman had called to see me. I went into the room where he was, and the first question he asked me, after passing a compliment was: "How many members have you in your Church?" I replied that we had between fifteen hundred and two thousand in this branch. He then asked: "Wherein do you differ from other Christian denominations? " I replied, that we believe the Bible, and they do not. However, he affirmed that he believed the Bible. I told him then to be baptized. He replied that he did not realize it to be his duty. But when I laid before him the principles of the Gospel, viz: faith and repentance; baptism, for the remission of sins; and the laying on of hands, for the reception of the Holy Ghost, he manifested much surprise. I observed that the hour for school had arrived, and I must attend. The man appeared astonished at our doctrine, but by no means hostile.</p>
<p><a name="379" id="379"></a>[Page 379]</p>
<p><strong>Washing and Anointings in Kirtland Temple.</strong></p>
<p>About three o'clock, p. m., I dismissed the school, and the Presidency retired to the attic story of the printing office, where we attended the ordinance of washing our bodies in pure water. We also perfumed our bodies and our heads in the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>At early candle-light I met with the Presidency at the west school room, in the Temple, to attend to the ordinance of anointing our heads with holy oil; also the Councils of Kirtland and Zion met in the two adjoining rooms, and waited in prayer while we attended to the ordinance. I took the oil in my left hand, Father Smith being seated before me, and the remainder of the Presidency encircled him round about. We then stretched our right hands towards heaven, and blessed the oil, and consecrated it in the name of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>The Prophet Blessed to Lead Israel in the Last Days.</strong></p>
<p>We then laid our hands upon our aged Father Smith, and invoked the blessings of heaven. I then anointed his head with the consecrated oil, and sealed many blessings upon him. The Presidency then in turn laid their hands upon his head, beginning at the oldest, until they had all laid their hands upon him, and pronounced such blessings upon his head, as the Lord put into their hearts, all blessing him to be our Patriarch, to anoint our heads, and attend to all duties that pertain to that office. The Presidency then took the seat in their turn, according to their age, beginning at the oldest, and received their anointing and blessing under the hands of Father Smith. And in my turn, my father anointed my head, and sealed upon me the blessings of Moses, to lead Israel in the latter days, even as Moses led him in days of old; also the blessings of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. All of the Presidency laid their hands upon me, and pronounced upon my head many prophecies and blessings, many of which I shall not notice at this time. But as Paul said, so say I, let us come to visions and revelations.</p>
<p><a name="380" id="380"></a>[Page 380]</p>
<p><strong>The Prophet's Vision of the Celestial Kingdom; Alvin Smith.</strong></p>
<p>The heavens were opened upon us, and I beheld the celestial kingdom of God, and the glory thereof, whether in the body or out I cannot tell. I saw the transcendent beauty of the gate through which the heirs of that kingdom will enter, which was like unto circling flames of fire; also the blazing throne of God, whereon was seated the Father and the Son. I saw the beautiful streets of that kingdom, which had the appearance of being paved with gold. I saw Fathers Adam and Abraham, and my father and mother, my brother, Alvin, that has long since slept, and marvelled as that he had obtained an inheritance in that kingdom, seeing that he had departed this life before the Lord had set His hand to gather Israel the second time, and had not been baptized for the remission of sins.</p>
<p>Thus came the voice of the Lord unto me, saying--</p>
<p>Revelation.</p>
<p>All who have died without a knowledge of this Gospel, who would have received it if they had been permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the celestial kingdom of God; also all that shall die henceforth without a knowledge of it, who would have received it with all their hearts, shall be heirs of that kingdom, for I, the Lord, will judge all men according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts.</p>
<p><a name="381" id="381"></a>[Page 381]</p>
<p><strong>The Salvation of Children.</strong></p>
<p>And I also beheld that all children who die before they arrive at the years of accountability, are saved in the celestial kingdom of heaven. I saw the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb, who are now upon the earth, who hold the keys of this last ministry, in foreign lands, standing together in a circle, much fatigued, with their clothes tattered and feet swollen, with their eyes cast downward, and Jesus standing in their midst, and they did not behold Him. The Savior looked upon them and wept.</p>
<p><strong>The Prophet's Vision of the Twelve.</strong></p>
<p>I also beheld Elder M'Lellin in the south, standing upon a hill, surrounded by a vast multitude, preaching to them, and a lame man standing before him supported by his crutches; he threw them down at his word and leaped as a hart, by the mighty power of God. Also, I saw Elder Brigham Young standing in a strange land, in the far south and west, in a desert place, upon a rock in the midst of about a dozen men of color, who appeared hostile. He was preaching to them in their own tongue, and the angel of God standing above his head, with a drawn Sword in his hand, protecting him, but he did not see it. And I finally saw the Twelve in the celestial kingdom of God. I also beheld the redemption of Zion, and many things which the tongue of man cannot describe in full.</p>
<p><strong>Ministrations of Angels.</strong></p>
<p>Many of my brethren who received the ordinance with me saw glorious visions also. Angels ministered unto them as well as to myself, and the power of the Highest rested upon us, the house was filled with the glory of God, and we shouted Hosanna to God and the Lamb. My scribe also received his anointing with us, and saw, in a vision, the armies of heaven protecting the Saints in their return to Zion, and many things which I saw.</p>
<p>The Bishop of Kirtland with his Counselors, and the Bishop of Zion with his Counselors, were present with us, and received their anointings under the hands of Father Smith, and this was confirmed by the Presidency, and the glories of heaven were unfolded to them also.</p>
<p><a name="382" id="382"></a>[Page 382]</p>
<p><strong>High Councils of Zion and Kirtland Anointed.</strong></p>
<p>We then invited the High Councilors of Kirtland and Zion into our room, and President Hyrum Smith anointed the head of the President of the Councilors in Kirtland, and President David Whitmer the head of the President of the Councilors of Zion. The President of each quorum then anointed the heads of his colleagues, each in his turn, beginning at the oldest.</p>
<p><strong>Further Visions and Revelations.</strong></p>
<p>The visions of heaven were opened to them also. Some of them saw the face of the Savior, and others were ministered unto by holy angels, and the spirit of prophecy and revelation was poured out in mighty power; and loud hosannas, and glory to God in the highest, saluted the heavens, for we all communed with the heavenly host. And I saw in my vision all of the Presidency in the celestial kingdom of God, and many others that were present. Our meeting was opened by singing, and prayer was offered up by the head of each quorum; and closed by singing, and invoking the benediction of heaven, with uplifted hands. Retired between one and two o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p><em>Friday 22.</em>--Attended at the school room at the usual hour, but instead of pursuing our studies, we spent the time in rehearsing to each other the glorious scenes that occurred on the preceding evening, while attending to the ordinance of holy anointing.</p>
<p><strong>Anointing of the Twelve and Seventy.</strong></p>
<p>In the evening we met at the same place, with the Council of the Twelve, and the Presidency of the Seventy, who were to receive this ordinance [of anointing and blessing]. The High Councils of Kirtland and Zion were present also.</p>
<p>After calling to order and organizing, the Presidency proceeded to consecrate the oil.</p>
<p>We then laid our hands upon Elder Thomas B. Marsh, who is President of the Twelve, and ordained him to the authority of anointing his brethren. I then poured the consecrated oil upon his head, in the name of Jesus Christ, and sealed such blessings upon him as the Lord put into my heart. The rest of the Presidency then laid their hands upon him and blessed him, each in his turn, beginning at the oldest. He then anointed and blessed his brethren from the oldest to the youngest. I also laid my hands upon them, and pronounced many great and glorious things upon their heads. The heavens were opened, and angels ministered unto us.</p>
<p><a name="383" id="383"></a>[Page 383]</p>
<p>The Twelve then proceeded to anoint and bless the Presidency of the Seventy, and seal upon their heads power and authority to anoint their brethren.</p>
<p>The heavens were opened unto Elder Sylvester Smith, and he, leaping up, exclaimed: "The horsemen of Israel and the chariots thereof."</p>
<p>Brother Don C. Smith was also anointed and blessed to preside over the High Priests' quorum.</p>
<p><strong>Blessing of the Lord's Anointed.</strong></p>
<p>President Rigdon arose to conclude the services of the evening by invoking the blessing of heaven upon the Lord's anointed, which he did in an eloquent manner; the congregation shouted a long hosanna: the gift of tongues fell upon us in mighty power, angels mingled their voices with ours, while their presence was in our midst, and unceasing praises swelled our bosoms for the space of half-an-hour.</p>
<p>I then observed to the brethren, that it was time to retire. We accordingly closed our interview and returned home at about two o'clock in the morning, and the Spirit and visions of God attended me through the night.</p>
<p>To the petitions which we sent up to Missouri, Governor Dunklin replied as follows: <a class="footnote" href="#fn-2">2</a></p>
<p>City of Jefferson, Jan. 22nd, 1836.</p>
<p>To Messrs. W. W. Phelps and Others,</p>
<p>Gentlemen:--Your numerous petitions, post-marked "Kirtland," came safe to hand. It is unnecessary for me to repeat to you my feelings on the subject of your grievances. What they were you have been already apprised, and, they have undergone no change. Your case was presented by me to the last General Assembly of the state. They did not legislate upon the subject. I am, however, persuaded, that it was for want of a constitutional power to pass any law that could afford you a proper remedy, prevented their acting upon the subject. Your feelings are very natural, when such causes exist to produce them; but you misconceive your case, and, consequently, do not advert to the proper remedy. You cannot make a case of <em>invasion or insurrection </em>of the outrages committed upon your persons or property in Jackson County. And, unless one of those could be made out, it would be idle to address the President of the United States. If such a case had been made out, as Executive of this state, I should have immediately ordered out a military force to repel or suppress it. The mob in New York, to which you cite me, is not in point. The military force was there resorted to, for the purpose of <em>quieting </em>the mob. You wish this kind of a force used to <em>restore </em>justice. However palpable and grievous the outrages have been upon you, your only remedy for injuries done must be in and through the courts of justice. On a former occasion I informed you I was then in correspondence with the General Government, for a depot of arms, on the Missouri river, near our western boundary line. For reasons unknown to me, the Secretary of War has taken no steps during the last year towards the fulfillment of the subject. I have renewed the subject through our delegation in Congress, this winter. When this object shall be attained, it may furnish you a place of resort, for protection, in case of emergency, should you think proper to risk yourselves on your lands, in Jackson County, again.</p>
<p><a name="384" id="384"></a>[Page 384]</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>[Signed] Danl. Dunklin.</p>
<p><strong>Doubts of Alva Beaman.</strong></p>
<p><em>Saturday, 23.</em>--Attended at the school room, as usual, and we came together filled with the Spirit, as on the past evening, and did not feel like studying, but commenced conversing upon heavenly things, and we spent the day agreeably and profitably. Elder Alva Beaman had been tempted to doubt the things which we received the evenings before, and he made an humble confession, and asked forgiveness of the school, which was joyfully accorded him, and he said he would try to resist Satan in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Continuation of Spiritual Meetings.</strong></p>
<p><em>Sunday, 24.</em>--Met the several quorums in the room under the printing office, and, after organizing and opening by prayer, called upon the High Council of Kirtland to proceed and confess their sins, as they might be directed by the Spirit, and they occupied the first part of the day, and confessed and exhorted as the Spirit led.</p>
<p><a name="385" id="385"></a>[Page 385]</p>
<p>In the afternoon, attended meeting again, and saw the bread and wine administered to the quorums and brethren who were present.</p>
<p>In the evening met the Presidency in the chamber over the printing room, and counseled on the subject of endowment, and the preparation for the solemn assembly, which is to be called when the house of the Lord is finished.</p>
<p><strong>Illness of Warren Parrish.</strong></p>
<p><em>Monday, 25.</em>--Received a line from my scribe, informing me of his ill health, as follows--</p>
<p>Brother Joseph--My great desire is to be in your company and in the assembly of the Saints, where God opens the heavens, and exhibits the treasures of eternity. It is the only thing that has stimulated me, for a number of days past, to leave my house; for be assured, dear brother, my bodily affliction is severe. I have a violent cough, more especially at night, which deprives me of my appetite, and my strength fails, and writing has a particular tendency to injure my lungs, while I am under the influence of such a cough. I therefore, with reluctance, send your journal to you, until my health improves.</p>
<p>Yours in haste,</p>
<p>Warren Parrish.</p>
<p>P. S.--Brother Joseph, pray for me, and ask the prayers of the class on my account also.</p>
<p>W. P.</p>
<p>Appointed Elder Sylvester Smith, acting scribe, for the time being, or, till Elder Parrish shall recover his health. Spent the day at home, receiving visitors.</p>
<p><strong>Arrival of Prof. Seixas.</strong></p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 26.</em>--Mr. Seixas arrived from Hudson, to teach the Hebrew language, and I attended upon the organizing of the class, for the purpose of receiving lectures upon Hebrew grammar. His hours of instruction are from ten to eleven, a. m. ; and from two to three, p. m. His instruction pleased me much. I think he will be a help to the class in learning Hebrew.</p>
<p><a name="386" id="386"></a>[Page 386]</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 27.</em>--Attended school as usual, and also attended to other matters which came before me.</p>
<p><em>Thursday, 28.</em>--Attended school at the usual hour.</p>
<p><strong>Continuation of Ministrations and Visions.</strong></p>
<p>In the evening met the quorum of High Priests, in the west room of the upper loft of the Lord's house, and, in company with my counselors, consecrated and anointed the counselors of the presidents of the High Priests' quorum, and, having instructed them and set the quorum in order, I left them to perform the holy anointing, and went to the quorum of Elders at the other end of the room. I assisted in anointing the counselors of the president of the Elders, and gave the instruction necessary for the occasion, and left the president and his counselors to anoint the Elders while I should go to the adjoining room, and attend to organizing and instructing the quorum of the Seventy.</p>
<p>I found the Twelve Apostles assembled with this quorum, and I proceeded, with the quorum of the Presidency, to instruct them, and also the seven presidents of the Seventy Elders, to call upon God with up-lifted hands, to seal the blessings which had been promised to them by the holy anointing. As I organized this quorum, with the presidency in this room, President Sylvester Smith saw a pillar of fire rest down and abide upon the heads of the quorum, as we stood in the midst of the Twelve.</p>
<p>When the Twelve and the seven presidents were through with their sealing prayer, I called upon President Sidney Rigdon to seal them with uplifted hands; and when he had done this, and cried hosanna, that all the congregation should join him, and shout hosanna to God and the Lamb, and glory to God in the highest. It was done so, and Elder Roger Orton saw a mighty angel riding upon a horse of fire, with a flaming sword in his hand, followed by five others, encircle the house, and protect the Saints, even the Lord's anointed, from the power of Satan and a host of evil spirits, which were striving to disturb the Saints.</p>

<p>President William Smith, one of the Twelve, saw the heavens opened, and the Lord's host protecting the Lord's anointed.</p>
<p>President Zebedee Coltrin, one of the seven presidents of the Seventy, saw the Savior extended before him, as upon the cross, and a little after, crowned with glory upon his head above the brightness of the sun.</p>
<p>After these things were over, and a glorious vision, which I saw, had passed, I instructed the seven presidents to proceed and anoint the Seventy, and returned to the room of the High Priests and Elders, and attended to the sealing of what they had done, with up-lifted hands.</p>
<p>The Lord assisted my brother, Don Carlos, the president of the High Priests, to go forward with the anointing of the High Priests, so that he had performed it to the acceptance of the Lord, notwithstanding he was very young and inexperienced in such duties; and I felt to praise God with a loud hosanna, for His goodness to me and my father's family, and to all the children of men. Praise the Lord, all ye, His Saints, praise His holy name.</p>
<p>After these quorums were dismissed, I retired to my home, filled with the Spirit, and my soul cried hosanna to God and the Lamb, through the silent watches of the night; and while my eyes were closed in sleep, the visions of the Lord were sweet unto me, and His glory was round about me. Praise the Lord.</p>
<p><em>Friday, 29.</em>--Attended school and read Hebrew. I received a line from the presidency of the Elders' quorum, they wishing to know whom they should receive into their quorum, I answered verbally.</p>
<p><strong>The Prophet Feasts his Father's Family.</strong></p>
<p>Afternoon, I called in all my father's family and made a feast, and related my feelings towards them. My father pronounced patriarchal blessings on the heads of Henry Gannet, Charles H. Smith, Marietta Carter, Angeline Carter, Johanna Carter, and Nancy Carter. This was a good time to me, and all the family rejoiced together. We continued the meeting till about eight o'clock in the evening, and related the goodness of God to us, in opening our eyes to see the visions of heaven, and in sending His holy angels to minister unto us the word of life. We sang the praise of God in animated strains, and the power of union and love was felt and enjoyed.</p>

<p><em>Saturday, 30.</em>--Attended school, as usual, and waited upon several visitors, and showed them the record of Abraham. Mr. Seixas, our Hebrew teacher, examined it with deep interest, and pronounced it to be original beyond all doubt. He is a man of excellent understanding, and has a knowledge of many languages which were spoken by the ancients, and he is an honorable man, so far as I can judge yet.</p>
<p>Resolutions.</p>
<p>At a conference of the Presidency of the Church, it was resolved that no one be ordained to an office in the Church in Kirtland, without the voice of the several quorums, when assembled for Church business.</p>
<p>Resolved--That Alva Beaman, president of the Elders, be directed to give to the Presidents of the Church a list of the names of the several Elders, comprising his quorum, and all other Elders in Kirtland, not belonging to any quorum now established.</p>
<p>Resolved--That Harvey Whitlock be restored to the Church, in full fellowship, on his being rebaptized, and after, be ordained to the High Priesthood.</p>
<p>Oliver Cowdery, Clerk.</p>
<p><strong>Anointing the Seventy.</strong></p>
<p>In the evening, went to the upper rooms of the Lord's house, and set the different quorums in order. Instructed the presidents of the Seventy concerning the order of their anointing, and requested them to proceed and anoint the Seventy. Having set all the quorums in order, I returned to my house, being weary with continual anxiety and labor, in putting all the authorities in order, and in striving to purify them for the solemn assembly, according to the commandment of the Lord.</p>

<p><em>Sunday, 31.</em>--Attended divine service in the school house, arranged the several quorums of the authorities of the Church, appointed doorkeepers to keep order about the door, because of the crowd, and to prevent the house from being excessively crowded. The High Council of Zion occupied the first part of the day, in speaking as they were led, and relating experiences, trials, etc.</p>
<p>Afternoon. House came to order, as usual, and President Sidney Rigdon delivered a short discourse, and we attended to the breaking of bread.</p>
<p>In the evening, my father attended to the blessing of three brethren, at President Oliver Cowdery's. Spent the evening at home.</p>

<p><a name="fn-1" id="fn-1"></a>1. Evidently this matter concerning Warren A. Cowdery was afterwards taken up and settled amicably, as the Doctor published the following note of explanation and acknowledgment in the February, 1836, number of the <em>Messenger and Advocate:</em></p>
<p>"Notice.</p>
<p>"I hereby give to all whom it may concern, that Messrs. T. B. Marsh and others, denominated the 'Twelve,' while on their mission to the East, last season, received a letter from the Presidency of the Church in which they were censured for neglecting to teach the Church in Freedom, Cattaraugus County, N. Y., the necessity of contributing of their earthly substance for the building of the House of the Lord in this place. The rebuke from the Presidency, (as the undersigned has been informed) was predicated upon a letter addressed by him, to the presidents or some one of them, stating that they, the Twelve, taught no such thing. The undersigned although actuated by the purest motives at the time he wrote believing he had stated nothing but the truth, has since become satisfied from the best of evidence, that that particular item in their instructions was not omitted as be had represented, he, therefore, most deeply regrets it, being sensible as he now is, that he was the cause (although innocent) of wounding the best of feelings, and depressing spirits buoyant with hope, while in the field of useful labor at a distance from home."--W. A. Cowdery.</p>

And is placed here in the Prophet's narrative, under the date on which it was written, <em>viz.</em> January 22, 1836.</p>
