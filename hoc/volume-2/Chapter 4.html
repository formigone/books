<p><strong>The Whipping of Ira J. Willis.</strong></p>
<p><em>Monday, March 31.</em>--This day, Ira J. Willis, a young man who had been in the Church for some time, and who was driven from Jackson county into Clay county, returned thither to look for a stray cow, and while at the house of Esquire Manship, a justice of the peace (where he had called with Brother John Follet, to prove his title to the cow), was caught by that unhung land pirate and inhuman monster, Moses Wilson, and whipped in a most cruel and savage manner, while surrounded by some half dozen of the old mobbers. This was an unpardonable act; all that know Mr. Willis can bear testimony that he is a young man, honest, peaceable and unoffending, working righteousness, and molesting no one, May God reward Moses Wilson according to his works.</p>
<p>I went to Chardon today to attend the court in the case of "Doctor" Philastus Hurlburt.</p>
<p><strong>The Trial of "Doctor" Hurlburt for Threatening the Prophet's Life.</strong></p>
<p><em>April 1.</em>--This day at Brother Rider's in Chardon. The court has not brought forward Hurlburt's trial yet, and we were engaged in issuing subpoenas for witnesses. My soul delighteth in the law of the Lord, for He forgiveth my sins, and will confound mine enemies. The Lord shall destroy him who has lifted his heel against me, even that wicked man Dr. Philastus Hurlburt; He will deliver him to the fowls of heaven, and his bones shall be cast to the blasts of the wind, for he lifted his arm against the Almighty, therefore the Lord shall destroy him.</p>
<p><a name="47" id="47"></a>[Page 47]</p>
<p>Wednesday, April the 2nd, and Thursday, the 3rd, attended the court. Hurlburt was on trial for threatening my life. Friday morning I returned home, and in the evening attended Council, of which the following are the minutes:</p>
<p>Minutes of Council.</p>
<p>Kirtland, April 4, 1834.</p>
<p>This evening a Council of High Priests assembled at the house of President Joseph Smith, Jun., to reconsider the case of brother George F. James. President Joseph Smith, Jun., presiding.</p>
<p>Brother George said that he had often promised to take up his cross and magnify his calling, but had failed, and ought to have written to the President ere this time and given him the information that this pecuniary affairs called his attention at home, which prevented his fulfilling the promise he made to President Joseph Smith, in going out to proclaim the Gospel; and he sincerely asked pardon of the Lord, and of his brethren, and particularly of Brother Joseph. He also said he was willing to ask the forgiveness of this Church. He said relative to certain charges, which were, that he "had not attended meetings, and had treated lightly some of the weak," etc.; that he had attended meetings generally; and as far as speaking or treating lightly any brother because of his weakness, that was foreign from his mind, and was that which he had never done, nor could he ever and such principles in his bosom.</p>
<p>President Joseph Smith said he had no hardness; he only wished Brother George to consider this as a chastisement, and that the Council were bound to take notice of his conduct heretofore; but now, if Brother George was willing to walk according to the new covenant, he should have his hand of fellowship. The Council then expressed their satisfaction at Brother George's confession.</p>

<p><em>April 5--</em>I went to Chardon as a witness for Father Johnson, and returned in the evening. Mr. Russell, the state's attorney for Portage county, called on me. He approached me in a gentlemanly manner, and treated me with great respect.</p>
<p><strong>Special Prayer.</strong></p>
<p><em>April 7.</em>--Bishop Whitney, Elder Frederick G. Williams, Oliver Cowdrey, Heber C. Kimball, and myself, met in the council room, and bowed down before the Lord, and prayed that He would furnish the means to deliver the Firm from debt, that they might be set at liberty; also, that I might prevail against that wicked man Hurlburt, and that he might be put to shame.</p>
<p><a name="48" id="48"></a>[Page 48]</p>
<p>The Presidency wrote Elder Orson Hyde, who yet remained in the state of New York, as follows:</p>
<p>Kirtland, April 7, 1834.</p>
<p>Dear Brother Orson:--We received yours of the 31st ultimo in due course of mail, and were much grieved on learning that you were not likely to succeed according to our expectations. Myself, Brothers Newel, Frederick and Oliver, retired to the translating room, where prayer was wont to be made, and unbosomed our feelings before God; and cannot but exercise faith yet that you, in the miraculous providences of God, will succeed in obtaining help. The fact is, unless we can obtain help, I myself cannot go to Zion, and if I do not go, it will be impossible to get my brethren in Kirtland, any of them, to go; and if we do not go, it is in vain for our eastern brethren to think of going up to better themselves by obtaining so goodly a land, (which now can be obtained for one dollar and one quarter per acre,) and stand against that wicked mob; for unless they do the will of God, God will not help them; and if God does not help them, all is vain.</p>
<p>Now the fact is, this is the head of the Church and the life of the body; and those able men, as members of the body, God has appointed to be hands to administer to the necessities of the body. Now if a man's hand refuses to administer to the necessities of his body, it must perish of hunger; and if the body perish, all the members perish with it; and if the head fail. the whole body is sickened, the heart faints, and the body dies, the spirit takes its exit, and the carcase remains to be devoured by worms.</p>
<p>Now, Brother Orson, if this Church, which is essaying to be the Church of Christ will not help us, when they can do it without sacrifice, with those blessings which God has bestowed upon them, I prophesy--I speak the truth, I lie not--God shall take away their talent, and give it to those who have no talent, and shall prevent them from ever obtaining a place of refuge, or an inheritance upon the land of Zion; therefore they may tarry, for they might as well be overtaken where they are, as to incur the displeasure of God, and fall under His wrath by the way side, as to fall into the hands of a merciless mob, where there is no God to deliver, as salt that has lost its savor, and is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be trodden under foot of men.</p>
<p>We therefore adjure you to beseech them, in the name of the Lord, by the Son of God, to lend us a helping hand; and if all this will not soften their hearts to administer to our necessity for Zion's sake, turn your back upon them, and return speedily to Kirtland; and the blood of Zion be upon their heads, even as upon the heads of her enemies; and let their recompense be as the recompense of her enemies; for thus shall it come to pass, saith the Lord of Hosts, who has the cattle upon a thousand hills, who has put forth His Almighty hand to bring to pass His strange act; and what man shall put forth his hand to steady the ark of God, or be found turning a deaf ear to the voice of His servant? God shall speak in due time, and all will be declared. Amen.</p>

<p>Oliver Cowdery.</p>
<p><strong>Judgment Against Hurlburt.</strong></p>
<p><em>April 9.</em>--After an impartial trial, the court decided that Dr. Philastus Hurlburt be bound over, under two hundred dollar bonds, to keep the peace for six months, and pay the cost, which amounted to nearly three hundred dollars, all of which was in answer to our prayers, for which I thank my Heavenly Father. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-1">1</a></p>
<p><strong>Dissolution of the United Order in Kirtland.</strong></p>
<p>On the 10th, had a council of the United Order, in which it was agreed that the Order should be dissolved, and each one have his stewardship set off to him.</p>
<p>The same day the brethren in Clay county, Missouri, executed the following letters and petitions, according to the revelation. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-2">2</a></p>
<p><a name="50" id="50"></a>[Page 50]</p>
<p><em>Friday, April 11.</em>--I attended meeting, and Father Tyler was restored to the fellowship of the Church.</p>
<p>On the 12th, I went to a place near Lake Erie, and spent the day in fishing, and visiting the brethren.</p>
<p><em>Sunday, 13.</em>--Was sick, and unable to attend meeting.</p>
<p><em>Monday, 14.</em>--I purchased some hay and oats, and got them home.</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 15.</em>--Hauled a load of hay; and on Wednesday plowed and sowed oats for Brother Frederick G. Williams,</p>
<p><strong>Deliverance of Zion Considered.</strong></p>
<p><em>Thursday, April 17.</em>--I attended a meeting agreeable to appointment, at which time the important subjects of the deliverance of Zion and to building of the Lord's House in Kirtland were discussed by Elder Rigdon. After the lecture, I requested the brethren and sisters to contribute all the money they could for the deliverance of Zion; and received twenty-nine dollars and sixty-eight cents.</p>
<p><strong>An Assault Thwarted by the Spirit.</strong></p>
<p><em>April 18.</em>--In company with Elders Sidney Rigdon, Oliver Cowdery and Zebedee Coltrin, I left Kirtland for New Portage, to attend a conference; dined at W. W. Williams', in Newburg, and continuing our journey, after dark, we were hailed by a man who desired to ride. We were checked by the Spirit, and refused. He professed to be sick, but in a few minutes was joined by two others, who followed us hard, cursing and swearing; but we were successful in escaping their hands, through the providence of the Lord, and stayed that night at a tavern, where we were treated with civility.</p>
<p><strong>An Occasion of Prayer and Blessing.</strong></p>
<p><em>April 19.</em>--Continuing our journey, dined at Brother Joseph Bosworth's, in Copley, Medina County. Brother Bosworth was strong in the faith, and if faithful may do much good. We arrived the same day at Brother Jonathan Taylor's, in Norton, where we were received with kindness. We soon retired to the wilderness, where we united in prayer and supplication for the blessings of the Lord to be given unto His Church. We called upon the Father in the name of Jesus, to go with the brethren who were going to the land of Zion; and that I might have strength, and wisdom, and understanding sufficient to lead the people of the Lord, and to gather and establish the Saints upon the land of their inheritances, and organize them according to the will of Heaven, that they may be no more cast down forever, We then united in the laying on of hands.</p>
<p><a name="51" id="51"></a>[Page 51]</p>
<p>Elders Rigdon, Cowdery and Coltrin laid their hands on my head, and conferred upon me all the blessings necessary to qualify for me stand before the Lord, in my calling, and return again in peace and triumph, to enjoy the society of my brethren.</p>
<p>Those present then laid their hands upon the head of Elder Rigdon, and confirmed upon him the blessings of wisdom and knowledge to preside over the Church in my absence, also to have the Spirit to assist Elder Cowdery in conducting the <em>Star,</em> in arranging the Book of Covenants; and pronounced the blessings of old age and peace upon him, till Zion is built up, and Kirtland established, till all his enemies are under his feet, and he receive a crown of eternal life in the kingdom of God with us.</p>
<p>Previous to blessing Elder Rigdon, we laid hands on Elder Oliver Cowdery, and confirmed upon him the blessings of wisdom and understanding sufficient for his station that he be qualified to assist Elder Rigdon in arranging the Church Book of Covenants, which is soon to be published, and have intelligence in all things to do the work of printing.</p>
<p>After blessing Elder Rigdon, we laid our hands upon Brother Zebedee Coltrin, and confirmed the blessings of wisdom to preach the Gospel, even till it spreads to the islands of the seas, and to be spared to see three score years and ten, and see Zion built up, and Kirtland established forever, and even at last to receive a crown of life. Our hearts rejoiced, and we were comforted with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><a name="52" id="52"></a>[Page 52]</p>
<p><em>Sunday, April 20.</em>--Elder Rigdon entertained a large congregation of Saints with an interesting discourse upon the Fullness of Times.</p>
<p><em>April 21.</em>--I attended conference, and had a glorious time. Some few volunteered to go to Zion, and others donated sixty-six dollars and thirty-seven cents for the benefit of the scattered brethren in Zion. The following is an extract from the minutes of the conference:</p>
<p>Minutes of Conference.</p>
<p>Norton, Medina County, Ohio, April 21, 1834.</p>
<p>This day a conference of Elders assembled at the dwelling house of Brother Carpenter. President Joseph Smith, Jun., read the second chapter of Joel's prophecy, prayed, and addressed the conference as follows:</p>
<p>"It is very difficult for us to communicate to the churches all that God has revealed to us, in consequence of tradition; for we are differently situated from any other people that ever existed upon this earth; consequently those former revelations cannot be suited to our conditions; they were given to other people, who were before us; but in the last days, God was to call a remnant, in which was to be deliverance, as well as in Jerusalem and Zion. Now if God should give no more revelations, where will we find Zion and this remnant? The time is near when desolation is to cover the earth, and then God will have a place of deliverance in His remnant, and in Zion."</p>
<p>The President then gave a relation of obtaining and translating the Book of Mormon, the revelation of the Priesthood of Aaron, the organization of the Church in 1830, the revelation of the High Priesthood, and the gift of the Holy Ghost poured out upon the Church; and said:</p>
<p>"Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations, and where is our religion? We have none; for without Zion, and a place of deliverance, we must fall; because the time is near when the sun will be darkened, and the moon turn to blood, and the stars fall from heaven, and the earth reel to and fro. Then, if this is the case, and if we are not sanctified and gathered to the places God has appointed, with all our former professions and our great love for the Bible, we must fall; we cannot stand; we cannot be saved; for God will gather out His Saints from the Gentiles, and then comes desolation and destruction, and none can escape except the pure in heart who are gathered."</p>
<p>Elder Rigdon addressed the conference, and said:</p>
<p>"On two points hang all the revelations that have ever been given, and these are the two advents of the Messiah. The first is past, and the second is now just before us; and consequently those who desire a part in this era which the angels desired to look into, have to be assembled with the Saints; for if they are not gathered, they must wail because of His coming. There is no part of His creation which will not feel a shock at this grand display of His power, for the ancient Saints will reign with Christ a thousand years. The gathered Saints will dwell under that reign, and these who are not gathered may expect to endure His wrath that length of time; for the rest of the dead are not to live till the thousand years are ended.</p>
<p><a name="53" id="53"></a>[Page 53]</p>
<p>"It is vain for men of this generation to think of laying up and providing inheritances for their children, except they lay it up in the place where deliverance is appointed by the voice of God; for these are the days of vengeance, as were the days of Jeremiah; because, before his eyes were closed in death, the Jews were led captive, and the land possessed by another people. And so in this day; while the father is laying up gold for his son, the destroyer may lay him lifeless at his feet, and where then is all his treasure? Therefore if we, the islands of the sea, and all the ends of the earth, desire an inheritance for ourselves and our children, and themselves and their children, it must be obtained where God has appointed the places of deliverance."</p>
<p>Elder Rigdon adverted to the former covenants to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and others of the ancients, which were to be realized in the last days; and spoke at some length upon the deliverance of Zion, the endowment of the Elders with power from on high according to former promises, and the spreading of the word of the Lord to the four winds. He first referred to the situation of the brethren in Missouri, and urged the importance of those who could, giving heed to the revelations by going up to their assistance; and those who could not go, to help those who are going with means for their expenses.</p>
<p>Elder Cowdery gave a brief relation of the mobbing in Missouri, and called for a contribution.</p>
<p>Elders Ambrose Palmer and Salmon Warner followed on the same subject.</p>
<p>Brother Joseph Bosworth spoke on the deliverance of Zion, and said he had no property, but if necessary for her deliverance he would sell his clothes at auction, if he might have left him as good a garment as the Savior had in the manger.</p>
<p>Others also spoke on the deliverance of Zion.</p>
<p>President Joseph Smith, Jun., prophesied.</p>
<p>"If Zion is not delivered, the time is near when all of this Church, wherever they may be found, will be persecuted and destroyed in like manner."</p>
<p><a name="54" id="54"></a>[Page 54]</p>
<p>Elder Rigdon gave an account of the endowment of the ancient apostles, and laid before the conference the dimensions of the House to be built in Kirtland, and rehearsed the promise to the Elders in the last days, which they were to realize after the House of the Lord was built.</p>
<p>Brother Bosworth then related a few items of a vision, as a testimony of those things contained in the revelation read by Elder Rigdon, and his remarks thereon.</p>
<p>President Smith explained the revelation concerning the building of the Lord's House.</p>
<p>Elder Rigdon then spoke on the spreading of the word of the Lord; followed by several of the brethren.</p>
<p>The conference voted that Thomas Tripp be excluded from the Church in consequence of his imprudent conduct, with the privilege of an appeal to the Bishop's Council in Kirtland.</p>
<p>President Smith then laid hands on certain children, and blessed them in the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>Elder Rigdon administered the Sacrament.</p>
<p>There were present seven High Priests, and thirteen Elders.</p>
<p>Adjourned to the Monday preceding the second Sunday in September</p>
<p>Closed by singing "Now my remnant of days," etc.</p>

<p><em>April 22.</em>--I returned to Kirtland.</p>
<p><strong>Return of the Prophet and Party to Kirtland.</strong></p>
<p><em>April 23.</em>--Assembled in Council with Elders Sidney Rigdon, Frederick G. Williams, Newel K. Whitney, John Johnson, and Oliver Cowdery; and united in asking the Lord to give Elder Zebedee Coltrin influence over Brother Jacob Myres, to obtain the money which he has gone to borrow for us, or cause him to come to this place and bring it himself. I also received the following:</p>
<p>Revelation given April 23, 1834, to Enoch [Joseph Smith, Jun.,] concerning the Order of the Church for the benefit of the poor. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-3">3</a></p>
<p>1. Verily I say unto you, my friends, I give unto you counsel, and a commandment, concerning all the properties which belong to the order which I commanded to be organized and established, to be an united order, and an everlasting order for the benefit of my Church, and for the salvation of men until I come,</p>
<p>2. With promise immutable and unchangeable, that inasmuch as those whom I commanded were faithful, they should be blessed with a multiplicity of blessings;</p>
<p>3. But inasmuch as they were not faithful, they were nigh unto cursing.</p>
<p>4. Therefore, inasmuch as some of my servants have not kept the commandment but have broken the covenant through covetousness, and with feigned words, I have cursed them with a very sore and grievous curse;</p>
<p>5. For I, the Lord, have decreed in my heart, that inasmuch as any man belonging to the order shall be found a transgressor, or, in other words, shall break the covenant with which ye are bound, he shall be cursed in his life, and shall be trodden down by whom I will,</p>
<p>6. For I, the Lord, am not to be mocked in these things;</p>
<p>7. And all this, that the innocent among you may not be condemned with the unjust, and that the guilty among you may not escape, because I, the Lord, have promised unto you a crown of glory at my right hand.</p>
<p>8. Therefore, inasmuch as you are found transgressors, ye cannot escape my wrath in your lives;</p>
<p>9. Inasmuch as ye are cut off for transgression, ye cannot escape the buffetings of Satan until the day of redemption.</p>
<p>10. And now I give unto you power from this very hour, that if any man among you, of the order, is found a transgressor, and repenteth not of the evil, that ye shall deliver him over unto the buffetings of Satan, and he shall not have power to bring evil upon you.</p>
<p>11. It is wisdom in me; therefore, a commandment I give unto you, that ye shall organize yourselves and appoint every man his stewardship,</p>
<p>12. That every man may give an account unto me of the stewardship which is appointed unto him;</p>
<p>13. For it is expedient that I, the Lord, should make every man accountable as a steward over earthly blessings, which I have made and prepared for my creatures.</p>
<p>14. I, the Lord, stretched out the heavens, and built the earth, my very handy-work, and all things therein are mine;</p>
<p>15. And it is my purpose to provide for my Saints, for all things are mine;</p>
<p>16. But it must needs be done in mine own way; and behold this is the way that I, the Lord, have decreed to provide for my Saints, that the poor shall be exalted, in that the rich are made low;</p>
<p>17. For the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare; yea, I prepared all things, and have given unto the children of men to be agents unto themselves.</p>
<p>18. Therefore, if any man shall take of the abundance which I have made, and impart not his portion, according to the law of my gospel, unto the poor and the needy, he shall, with the wicked, lift up his eyes in hell, being in torment.</p>
<p>19. And now, verily I say unto you, concerning the properties of the order.</p>
<p>20. Let my servant Pelagoram (Sidney Rigdon) have appointed unto him the place where he now resides, and the lot of Tahhanes (the tannery) for his stewardship, for his support while he is laboring in my vineyard, even as I will, when I shall command him;</p>
<p>21. And let all things be done according to the counsel of the order, and united consent or voice of the order, which dwell in the land of Shinehah (Kirtland).</p>
<p>22. And this stewardship and blessing I, the Lord, confer upon my servant Pelagoram (Sidney Rigdon), for a blessing upon him, and his seed after him;</p>
<p>23. And I will multiply blessings upon him, inasmuch as he will be humble before me.</p>
<p>24. And again, let my servant Mahemson (Martin Harris) have appointed unto him, for his stewardship, the lot of land which my Servant Zombre (John Johnson) obtained in exchange for his former inheritance, for him and his seed after him.</p>
<p>25. And inasmuch as he is faithful, I will multiply blessings upon him and his seed after him.</p>
<p>26. And let my servant Mahemson (Martin Harris) devote his moneys for the proclaiming of my words, according as my servant Gazelam (Joseph Smith, Jun.,) shall direct.</p>
<p>27. And again, let my servant Shederlaomach (Frederick G. Williams) have the place upon which he now dwells.</p>
<p>28. And let my servant Olihah (Oliver Cowdery) have the lot which is set off joining the house, which is to be for the Laneshine-house (printing office), which is lot number one, and also the lot upon which his father resides.</p>
<p>29. And let my servants Shederlaomach (Frederick G. Williams) and Olihah (Oliver Cowdery) have the Laneshine-house (printing office), and all things that pertain unto it;</p>
<p>30. And this shall be their stewardship which shall be appointed unto them:</p>
<p>31. And inasmuch as they are faithful, behold I will bless, and multiply blessings upon them.</p>
<p>32. And this is the beginning of the stewardship which I have appointed them, for them and their seed after them;</p>
<p>33. And inasmuch as they are faithful, I will multiply blessings upon them, and their seed after them, even a multiplicity of blessings.</p>
<p><a name="55" id="55"></a>[Page 55]</p>
<p>34. And again, let my servant Zombre (John Johnson) have the house in which he lives, and the inheritance--all, save the ground which has been reserved for the building of my houses, which pertains to that inheritance, and those lots which have been named for my servant Olihah (Oliver Cowdery).</p>
<p>35. And, inasmuch as he is faithful, I will multiply blessings upon him.</p>
<p>36. And it is my will that he should sell the lots that are laid off for the building up of the city of my Saints, inasmuch as it shall be made known to him by the voice of the Spirit, and according to the counsel of the order, and by the voice of the order.</p>
<p>37. And this is the beginning of the stewardship which I have appointed unto him, for a blessing unto him, and his seed after him;</p>
<p>38. And inasmuch as he is faithful, I will multiply a multiplicity of blessings upon him.</p>
<p>39. And let my servant Ahashdah (Newel K. Whitney) have appointed unto him the houses and lot where he now resides, and the lot and building on which the Ozondah (mercantile establishment) stands, and also the lot which is now on the corner south of the Ozondah (mercantile establishment), and also the lot upon which the Shule (ashery) is situated.</p>
<p>40. And all this I have appointed unto my servant Ahashdah (Newel K. Whitney) for his stewardship, for a blessing upon him and his seed after him, for the benefit of the Ozondah (mercantile establishment) of my order which I have established for my Stake in the land of Shinehah (Kirtland).</p>
<p>41. Yea, verily, this is the stewardship which I have appointed unto my servant Ahashdah (N. K. Whitney), even this whole Ozondah (mercantile establishment), him and his agent, and his seed after him;</p>
<p>42. And inasmuch as he is faithful in keeping my commandments which I have given unto him, I will multiply blessings upon him, and his seed after him, even a multiplicity of blessings.</p>
<p>43 And again, let my servant Gazelam (Joseph Smith, Jun.,) have appointed unto him the lot which is laid off for the building of my house, which is forty rods long, and twelve wide, and also the inheritance upon which his father now resides.</p>
<p>44. And this is the beginning of the stewardship which I have appointed unto him, for a blessing upon him, and upon his father.</p>
<p>45. For, behold, I have reserved an inheritance for his father, for his support; therefore he shall be reckoned in the house of my servant Gazelam (Joseph Smith, Jun.)</p>
<p>46. And I will multiply blessings upon the house of my servant Gazelam (Joseph Smith, Jun.,) inasmuch as he is faithful, even a multiplicity of blessings.</p>
<p>47. And now, a commandment I give unto you concerning Zion, that you shall no longer be bound as an United Order to your brethren of Zion, only on this wise:</p>
<p>48. After you are organized, you shall be called the United Order of the Stake of Zion, the city of Shinehah (Kirtland). And your brethren, after they are organized, shall be called the United Order of the City of Zion.</p>
<p>49. And they shall be organized in their own names, and in their own name; and they shall do their business in their own name, and in their own names;</p>
<p>50. And you shall do business in your own name, and in your own names.</p>
<p>51. And this I have commanded to be done for your salvation, and also for their salvation, in consequence of their being driven out and that which is to come.</p>
<p>52. The covenants being broken through transgression, by covetousness and feigned words;</p>
<p>53. Therefore you are dissolved as a United Order with your brethren, that you are not bound only up to this hour unto them, only on this wise, as I said, by loan as shall be agreed by this order in council, as your circumstances will admit and the voice of the council direct.</p>
<p>54. And again a commandment I give unto you concerning your stewardships which I have appointed unto you.</p>
<p>55. Behold, all these properties are mine, or else your faith is vain, and ye are found hypocrites, and the covenants which ye have made unto me are broken;</p>
<p>56. And if the properties are mine, then ye are stewards, otherwise ye are no stewards.</p>
<p>57. But, verily I say unto you, I have appointed unto you to be stewards over mine house, even stewards indeed;</p>
<p>58. And for this purpose I have commanded you to organize yourselves even to shinelah (print) my words, the fullness of my scriptures, the revelations which I have given unto you, and which I shall hereafter, from time to time, give unto you,</p>
<p>59. For the purpose of building up my Church and Kingdom on the earth, and to prepare my people for the time when I shall dwell with them, which is nigh at hand.</p>
<p>60. And ye shall prepare for yourselves a place for a treasury, and consecrate it unto my name;</p>
<p>61. And ye shall appoint one among you to keep the treasury, and he shall be ordained unto this blessing;</p>
<p>62. And there shall be a seal upon the treasury, and all the sacred things shall be delivered into the treasury, and no man among you shall call it his own, or any part of it, for it shall belong to you all with one accord;</p>
<p>63. And I give it unto you from this very hour; and now see to it, that ye go to and make use of the stewardship which I have appointed unto you, exclusive of the sacred things, for the purpose of shinelane (printing) these sacred things as I have said;</p>
<p>64. And the avails of the sacred things shall be had in the treasury, and a seal shall be upon it, and it shall not be used or taken out of the treasury by any one, neither shall the seal be loosed which shall be placed upon it, only by the voice of the order, or by commandment.</p>
<p>65. And thus shall ye preserve the avails of the sacred things in the treasury for sacred and holy purposes:</p>
<p>66. And this shall be called the sacred treasury of the Lord; and a seal shall be kept upon it that it may be holy and consecrated unto the Lord.</p>
<p>67. And again, there shall be another treasury prepared, and a treasurer appointed to keep the treasury, and a seal shall be placed upon it;</p>
<p>68. And all moneys that you receive in your stewardships, by improving upon the properties which I have appointed unto you, in houses, or in lands, or in cattle, or in all things save it be the holy and sacred writings, which I have reserved unto myself, for holy and sacred purposes, shall be cast into the treasury as fast as you receive moneys, by hundreds, or by fifties, or by twenties, or by tens, or by fives;</p>
<p>69. Or in other words, if any man among you obtain five talents(dollars), let him cast them into the treasury; or if he obtain ten, or twenty, or fifty, or an hundred, let him do likewise;</p>
<p>70. And let not any among you say that it is his own, for it shall not be called his, nor any part of it;</p>
<p>71. And there shall not any part of it be used, or taken out of the treasury, only by the voice and common consent of the order.</p>
<p>72. And this shall be the voice and common consent of the order; that any man among you say to the treasurer, I have need of this to help me in my stewardship;</p>
<p>73. If it be five talents (dollars), or if it be ten talents (dollars,) or twenty, or fifty, or a hundred, the treasurer shall give unto him the sum which he requires, to help him in his stewardship.</p>
<p>74. Until he be found a transgressor, and it is manifest before the council of the order plainly, that he is an unfaithful and an unwise steward;</p>
<p>75. But so long as he is in full fellowship, and is faithful, and wise in his stewardship, this shall be his token unto the treasurer, that the treasurer shall not withhold.</p>
<p>76. But in case of transgression, the treasurer shall be subject unto the council and voice of the order.</p>
<p>77. And in case the treasurer is found an unfaithful and an unwise steward, he shall be subject to the council and voice of the order, and shall be removed out of his place, and another shall be appointed in his stead.</p>
<p>78. And again, verily I say unto you, concerning your debts, behold it is my will that you shall pay all your debts;</p>
<p>79. And it is my will that you shall humble yourselves before me, and obtain this blessing by your diligence and humility, and the prayer of faith;</p>
<p>80. And inasmuch as you are diligent and humble, and exercise the prayer of faith, behold, I will soften the hearts of those to whom you are in debt, until I shall send means unto you for your deliverance.</p>
<p>81. Therefore write speedily to Cainhannoch (New York), and write according to that which shall be dictated by my Spirit, and I will soften the hearts of those to whom you are in debt, that it shall be taken away out of their minds to bring affliction upon you.</p>
<p>82. And inasmuch as ye are humble and faithful, and call upon my name, behold I will give you the victory.</p>
<p>83. I give unto you a promise, that you shall be delivered this once out of your bondage;</p>
<p>84. Inasmuch as you obtain a chance to loan money by hundreds, or thousands, even until you shall loan enough to deliver yourselves from bondage, it is your privilege:</p>
<p>85. And pledge the properties which I have put into your hands, this once, by giving your names by common consent or otherwise, as it shall seem good unto you</p>
<p>86. I give unto you this privilege, this once, and behold, if you proceed to do the things which I have laid before you, according to my commandments, all these things are mine, and ye are my stewards, and the master will not suffer his house to be broken up. Even so. Amen.</p>
