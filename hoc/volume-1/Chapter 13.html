<p>Prospects of the Church at the Opening of the Year 1831--Removal of the Prophet Joseph from New York to Ohio--Doctrinal Development.</p>
<p><strong>Prospects of the Church--1831.</strong></p>
<p>The year 1831 opened with a prospect great and glorious for the welfare of the kingdom; for on the 2nd of January, 1831, a conference was held in the town of Fayette, New York, at which the ordinary business of the Church was transacted; and in addition, the following revelation was received:</p>
<p>Revelation, given January 2nd, 1831. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-1">1</a></p>
<p>1. Thus saith the Lord your God, even Jesus Christ, the Great I AM, Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the same which looked upon the wide expanse of eternity, and all the seraphic hosts of heaven, before the world was made;</p>
<p>2. The same which knoweth all things, for all things are present before mine eyes;</p>
<p>3. I am the same which spake, and the world was made, and all things came by me.</p>
<p>4. I am the same which have taken the Zion of Enoch into mine own bosom; and verily, I say, even as many as have believed in my name, for I am Christ, and in mine own name, by the virtue of the blood which I have spilt, have I pleaded before the Father for them.</p>
<p>5. But behold, the residue of the wicked have I kept in chains of darkness until the judgment of the great day, which shall come at the end of the earth;</p>
<p>6. And even so will I cause the wicked to be kept, that will not hear my voice but harden their hearts, and wo, wo, wo, is their doom.</p>
<p><a name="141" id="141"></a>[Page 141]</p>
<p>7. But behold, verily, verily, I say unto you that mine eyes are upon you. I am in your midst, and ye cannot see me;</p>
<p>8. But the day soon cometh that ye shall see me, and know that I am; for the veil of darkness shall soon be rent, and he that is not purified shall not abide the day.</p>
<p>9. Wherefore, gird up your loins and be prepared. Behold, the kingdom is yours, and the enemy shall not overcome.</p>
<p>10. Verily I say unto you, ye are clean, but not all; and there is none else with whom I am well pleased;</p>
<p>11. For all flesh is corrupted before me; and the powers of darkness prevail upon the earth, among the children of men, in the presence of all the hosts of heaven--</p>
<p>12. Which causeth silence to reign, and all eternity is pained, and the angels are waiting the great command to reap down the earth, to gather the tares that they may be burned; and, behold, the enemy is combined.</p>
<p>13. And now I show unto you a mystery, a thing which is had in secret chambers, to bring to pass even your destruction in process of time, and ye knew it not;</p>
<p>14. But now I tell it unto you, and ye are blessed, not because of your iniquity, neither your hearts of unbelief; for verily some of you are guilty before me, but I will be merciful unto your weakness.</p>
<p>15. Therefore, be ye strong from henceforth; fear not, for the kingdom is yours.</p>
<p>16. And for your salvation I give unto you a commandment, for I have heard your prayers, and the poor have complained before me, and the rich have I made, and all flesh is mine, and I am no respecter of persons.</p>
<p>17. And I have made the earth rich, and behold it is my footstool, wherefore, again I will stand upon it.</p>
<p>18. And I hold forth and deign to give unto you greater riches, even a land of promise, a land flowing with milk and honey, upon which there shall be no curse when the Lord cometh;</p>
<p>19. And I will give it unto you for the land of your inheritance, if you seek it with all your hearts.</p>
<p>20. And this shall be my covenant with you, ye shall have it for the land of your inheritance, and for the inheritance of your children forever, while the earth shall stand, and ye shall possess it again in eternity, no more to pass away.</p>
<p>21. But, verily I say unto you that in time ye shall have no king nor ruler, for I will be your king and watch over you.</p>
<p>22. Wherefore, hear my voice and follow me, and you shall be a free people, and ye shall have no laws but my laws when I come, for I am your law-giver, and what can stay my hand?</p>
<p><a name="142" id="142"></a>[Page 142]</p>
<p>23. But, verily I say unto you, teach one another according to the office wherewith I have appointed you;</p>
<p>24. And let every man esteem his brother as himself, and practise virtue and holiness before me.</p>
<p>25. And again I say unto you, let every man esteem his brother as himself.</p>
<p>26. For what man among you having twelve sons, and is no respecter of them, and they serve him obediently, and he saith unto the one: Be thou clothed in robes and sit thou here; and to the other: Be thou clothed in rags and sit thou there, and looketh upon his sons and saith I am just?</p>
<p>27. Behold, this I have given unto you as a parable, and it is even as I am. I say unto you, be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine.</p>
<p>28. And again, I say unto you that the enemy in the secret chambers seeketh your lives.</p>
<p>29. Ye hear of wars in far countries, and you say that there will soon be great wars in far countries, but ye know not the hearts of men in your own land.</p>
<p>30. I tell you these things because of your prayers; wherefore, treasure up wisdom in your bosoms, let the wickedness of men reveal these things unto you by their wickedness, in a manner which shall speak in your ears with a voice louder than that which shall shake the earth; but if ye are prepared, ye shall not fear.</p>
<p>31. And that ye might escape the power of the enemy, and be gathered unto me a righteous people, without spot and blameless--</p>
<p>32. Wherefore, for this cause I gave unto you the commandment that ye should go to the Ohio; and there I will give unto you my law; and there you shall be endowed with power from on high;</p>
<p>33. And from thence, whosoever I will, shall go forth among all nations, and it shall be told them what they shall do; for I have a great work laid up in store, for Israel shall be saved, and I will lead them whithersoever I will, and no power shall stay my hand.</p>
<p>34. And now, I give unto the church in these parts a commandment, that certain men among them shall be appointed, and they shall be appointed by the voice of the church.</p>
<p>35. And they shall look to the poor and the needy, and administer to their relief that they shall not suffer; and send them forth to the place which I have commanded them;</p>
<p>36. And this shall be their work, to govern the affairs of the property of this church.</p>
<p><a name="143" id="143"></a>[Page 143]</p>
<p>37. And they have farms that cannot be sold, let them be left or rented as seemeth them good.</p>
<p>38. See that all things are preserved; and when men are endowed with power from on high and sent forth, all these things shall be gathered unto the bosom of the church.</p>
<p>39. And if ye seek the riches which it is the will of the Father to give unto you, ye shall be the richest of all people, for ye shall have the riches of eternity; and it must needs be that the riches of the earth are mine to give; but beware of pride, lest ye become as the Nephites of old.</p>
<p>40. And again, I say unto you, I give unto you a commandment, that every man, both elder, priest, teacher, and also member, go to with his might, with the labor of his hands, to prepare and accomplish the things which I have commanded.</p>
<p>41. And let your preaching be the warning voice, every man to his neighbor, in mildness and in meekness.</p>
<p>42. And go ye out from among the wicked. Save yourselves. Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord. Even so. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>James Covill.</strong></p>
<p>Not long after this conference of the 2nd of January closed, there was a man came to me by the name of James Covill, who had been a Baptist minister for about forty years, and covenanted with the Lord that he would obey any command that the Lord would give to him through me, as His servant, and I received the following:</p>
<p>Revelation to James Covill, given at Fayette, New York, January 5th, 1831. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-2">2</a></p>
<p>1. Hearken and listen to the voice of him who is from all eternity to all eternity, the Great I AM, even Jesus Christ--</p>
<p>2. The light and life of the world; a light which shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not:</p>
<p>3. The same which came in the meridian of time unto mine own, and mine own received me not;</p>
<p>4. But to as many as received me, gave I power to become my sons; and even so will I give unto as many as will receive me, power to become my sons.</p>
<p>5. And verily, verily, I say unto you, he that receiveth my gospel receiveth me; and he that receiveth not my gospel receiveth not me.</p>
<p><a name="144" id="144"></a>[Page 144]</p>
<p>6. And this is my gospel--repentance and baptism by water, and then cometh the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost, even the Comforter, which showeth all things, and teacheth the peaceable things of the kingdom.</p>
<p>7. And now, behold, I say unto you, my servant James, I have looked upon thy works and I know thee.</p>
<p>8. And verily I say unto thee, thine heart is now right before me at this time; and, behold, I have bestowed great blessings upon thy head;</p>
<p>9. Nevertheless, thou hast seen great sorrow, for thou hast rejected me many times because of pride and the cares of the world.</p>
<p>10. But, behold, the days of thy deliverance are come, if thou wilt hearken to my voice, which saith unto thee: Arise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on my name, and you shall receive my Spirit, and a blessing so great as you never have known.</p>
<p>11. And if thou do this, I have prepared thee for a greater work. Thou shalt preach the fulness of my gospel, which I have sent forth in these last days, the covenant which I have sent forth to recover my people, which are of the house of Israel.</p>
<p>12. And it shall come to pass that power shall rest upon thee; thou shalt have great faith, and I will be with thee and go before thy face.</p>
<p>13. Thou art called to labor in my vineyard, and to build up my church, and to bring forth Zion, that it may rejoice upon the hills and flourish.</p>
<p>14. Behold, verily, verily, I say unto thee, thou art not called to go into the eastern countries, but thou art called to go to the Ohio.</p>
<p>15. And inasmuch as my people shall assemble themselves at the Ohio, I have kept in store a blessing such as is not known among the children of men, and it shall be poured forth upon their heads. And from thence men shall go forth into all nations.</p>
<p>16. Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that the people in Ohio call upon me in much faith, thinking I will stay my hand in judgment upon the nations, but I cannot deny my word.</p>
<p>17. Wherefore lay to with your might and call faithful laborers into my vineyard, that it may be pruned for the last time.</p>
<p>18. And inasmuch as they do repent and receive the fulness of my gospel, and become sanctified, I will stay mine hand in judgment.</p>
<p>19. Wherefore, go forth, crying with a loud voice, saying: The kingdom of heaven is at hand; crying: Hosanna! blessed be the name of the Most High God.</p>
<p>20. Go forth baptizing with water, preparing the way before my face for the time of my coming;</p>
<p>21. For the time is at hand; the day or the hour no man knoweth; but it surely shall come.</p>
<p><a name="145" id="145"></a>[Page 145]</p>
<p>22. And he that receiveth these things receiveth me; and they shall be gathered unto me in time and in eternity.</p>
<p>23. And again, it shall come to pass, that on as many as ye shall baptize with water, ye shall lay your hands, and they shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and shall be looking forth for the signs of my coming, and shall know me.</p>
<p>24. Behold, I come quickly. Even so. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>Why Covill Rejected the Commandment.</strong></p>
<p>As James Covill rejected the word of the Lord, and returned to his former principles and people, the Lord gave unto me and Sidney Rigdon the following revelation, explaining why he obeyed not the word:</p>
<p>Revelation given at Fayette, New York. January, 1831. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-3">3</a></p>
<p>1. Behold, verily I say unto you, that the heart of my servant James Covill was right before me, for he covenanted with me that he would obey my word.</p>
<p>2. And he received the word with gladness, but straightway Satan tempted him; and the fear of persecution and the cares of the world caused him to reject the word.</p>
<p>3. Wherefore he broke my covenant, and it remaineth with me to do with him as seemeth me good. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>The Prophet Removes to Ohio.</strong></p>
<p>The latter part of January, in company with Brothers Sidney Rigdon and Edward Partridge, I started with my wife for Kirtland, Ohio, where we arrived about the first of February, and were kindly received and welcomed into the house of Brother Newel K. Whitney. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-4">4</a> My wife and I lived in the family of Brother Whitney several weeks, and received every kindness and attention which could be expected, and especially from Sister Whitney.</p>
<p><strong>The Branch of the Church at Kirtland.</strong></p>
<p><a name="146" id="146"></a>[Page 146]</p>
<p>The branch of the Church in this part of the Lord's vineyard, which had increased to nearly one hundred members, were striving to do the will of God, so far as they knew it, though some strange notions and false spirits had crept in among them. With a little caution and some wisdom, I soon assisted the brethren and sisters to overcome them. The plan of "common stock," which had existed in what was called "the family," <a class="footnote" href="#fn-5">5</a> whose members generally had embraced the everlasting Gospel, was readily abandoned for the more perfect law of the Lord; and the false spirits were easily discerned and rejected by the light of revelation.</p>
<p><a name="147" id="147"></a>[Page 147]</p>
<p>The Lord gave unto the Church the following:</p>
<p>Revelation, given at Kirtland, Ohio, February 4th, 1831. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-6">6</a></p>
<p>1. Hearken and hear, O ye my people, saith the Lord and your God, ye whom I delight to bless with the greatest of all blessings, ye that hear me; and ye that hear me not will I curse, that have professed my name, with the heaviest of all cursings.</p>
<p>2. Hearken, O ye elders of my church whom I have called, behold I give unto you a commandment, that ye shall assemble yourselves together to agree upon my word;</p>
<p>3. And by the prayer of your faith ye shall receive my law, that ye may know how to govern my church and have all things right before me.</p>
<p>4. And I will be your ruler when I come; and behold, I come quickly, and ye shall see that my law is kept.</p>
<p>5. He that receiveth my law and doeth it, the same is my disciple; and he that saith he receiveth it and doeth it not, the same is not my disciple, and shall be cast out from among you;</p>
<p>6. For it is not meet that the things which belong to the children of the kingdom, shall be given to them that are not worthy, or to dogs, or the pearls to be cast before swine.</p>
<p>7. And again, it is meet that my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., should have a house built, in which to live and translate.</p>
<p>8. And again, it is meet that my servant Sidney Rigdon should live as seemeth him good, inasmuch as he keepeth my commandments.</p>
<p>9. And again, I have called my servant, Edward Partridge, and I give a commandment, that he should he appointed by the voice of the church, and ordained a bishop unto the church, to leave his merchandise and to spend all his time in the labors of the church;</p>
<p>10. To see to all things as it shall be appointed unto him in my laws in the day that I shall give them.</p>
<p>11. And this because his heart is pure before me, for he is like unto Nathaniel of old, in whom there is no guile.</p>
<p>12. These words are given unto you, and they are pure before me; wherefore, beware how you hold them, for they are to be answered upon your souls in the day of judgment. Even so. Amen.</p>
<p><a name="148" id="148"></a>[Page 148]</p>
<p><strong>Revelation Giving the Law of the Church.</strong></p>
<p>On the 9th of February, 1831, at Kirtland, in the presence of twelve Elders, and according to the promise heretofore made, <a class="footnote" href="#fn-7">7</a> the Lord gave the following revelation, embracing the law of the Church:</p>
<p>Revelation, given February, 1831. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-8">8</a></p>
<p>1. Hearken, O ye elders of my church, who have assembled yourselves together in my name, even Jesus Christ the Son of the living God, the Savior of the world; inasmuch as ye believe on my name and keep my commandments.</p>
<p>2. Again I say unto you, hearken and hear and obey the law which I shall give you.</p>
<p>3. For verily I say, as ye have assembled yourselves together according to the commandment wherewith I commanded you, and are agreed as touching this one thing, and have asked the Father in my name, even so ye shall receive.</p>
<p>4. Behold, verily I say unto you, I give unto you this first commandment, that ye shall go forth in my name, every one of you, excepting my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon.</p>
<p>5. And I give unto them a commandment that they shall go forth for a little season, and it shall be given by the power of the Spirit when they shall return.</p>
<p>6. And ye shall go forth in the power of my Spirit, preaching my gospel, two by two, in my name, lifting up your voices as with the sound of a trump, declaring my word like unto angels of God.</p>
<p>7. And ye shall go forth baptizing with water, saying: Repent ye, repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>
<p>8. And from this place ye shall go forth into the regions westward; and inasmuch as ye shall find them that will receive you ye shall build up my church in every region--</p>
<p>9. Until the time shall come when it shall be revealed unto you from on high, when the city of the New Jerusalem shall be prepared, that ye may be gathered in one, that ye may be my people and I will be your God.</p>
<p>10. And again, I say unto you, that my servant Edward Partridge shall stand in the office whereunto I have appointed him. And it shall come to pass, that if he transgress, another shall be appointed in his stead. Even so. Amen.</p>
<p><a name="149" id="149"></a>[Page 149]</p>
<p>11. Again, I say unto you, that it shall not be given to any one to go forth to preach my gospel, or to build up my church, except he be ordained by some one who has authority, and it is known to the church that he has authority and has been regularly ordained by the heads of the church.</p>
<p>12. And again, the elders, priests and teachers of this church shall teach the principles of my gospel, which are in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, in the which is the fulness of the gospel;</p>
<p>13. And they shall observe the covenants and church articles to do them, and these shall be their teachings, as they shall be directed by the Spirit.</p>
<p>14. And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit, ye shall not teach.</p>
<p>15. And all this ye shall observe to do as I have commanded concerning your teaching, until the fulness of my scriptures is given.</p>
<p>16. And as ye shall lift up your voices by the Comforter, ye shall speak and prophesy as seemeth me good;</p>
<p>17. For, behold, the Comforter knoweth all things, and beareth record of the Father and of the Son.</p>
<p>18. And now, behold, I speak unto the church. Thou shalt not kill; and he that kills shall not have forgiveness in this world, nor in the world to come.</p>
<p>19. And again, I say, thou shalt not kill; but he that killeth shall die.</p>
<p>20. Thou shalt not steal; and he that stealeth and will not repent shall be cast out.</p>
<p>21. Thou shalt not lie; he that lieth and will not repent, shall be cast out.</p>
<p>22. Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart and shalt cleave unto her and none else.</p>
<p>23. And he that looketh upon a woman to lust after her shall deny the faith, and shall not have the Spirit; and if he repents not he shall be cast out.</p>
<p>24. Thou shalt not commit adultery; and he that committeth adultery, and repenteth not, shall be cast out.</p>
<p>25. But he that has committed adultery and repents with all his heart, and forsaketh it, and doeth it no more, thou shalt forgive;</p>
<p>26. But if he doeth it again, he shall not be forgiven, but shall be cast out.</p>
<p>27. Thou shalt not speak evil of thy neighbor, nor do him any harm.</p>
<p>28. Thou knowest my laws concerning these things are given in my scriptures; he that sinneth and repenteth not shall be cast out.</p>
<p><a name="150" id="150"></a>[Page 150]</p>
<p>29. If thou lovest me, thou shalt serve me and keep all my commandments.</p>
<p>30. And behold, thou wilt remember the poor, and consecrate of thy properties for their support that which thou hast to impart unto them, with a covenant and a deed which cannot be broken.</p>
<p>31. And inasmuch as ye impart of your substance unto the poor, ye will do it unto me; and they shall be laid before the bishop of my church and his counselors, two of the elders, or high priests <a class="footnote" href="#fn-9">9</a> such as he shall appoint or has appointed and set apart for the purpose.</p>
<p>32. And it shall come to pass, that after they are laid before the bishop of my church, and after that he has received these testimonies concerning the consecration of the properties of my church, that they cannot be taken from the church, agreeable to my commandments, every man shall be made accountable unto me, a steward over his own property, or that which he has received by consecration, as much as is sufficient for himself and family.</p>
<p>33. And again, if there shall be properties in the hands of the Church, or any individuals of it, more than is necessary for their support after this first consecration, which is a residue to be consecrated unto the bishop, it shall be kept to administer to those who have not, from time to time, that every man who has need may be amply supplied and receive according to his wants.</p>
<p>34. Therefore, the residue shall be kept in my storehouse, to administer to the poor and the needy, as shall be appointed by the high council of the church, and the bishop and his council;</p>
<p>35. And for the purpose of purchasing lands for the public benefit of the church, and building houses of worship, and building up of the New Jerusalem which is hereafter to be revealed--</p>
<p>36. That my covenant people may be gathered in one in that day when I shall come to my temple. And this I do for the salvation of my people.</p>
<p>37. And it shall come to pass, that he that sinneth and repenteth not shall be cast out of the church, and shall not receive again that which he has consecrated unto the poor and the needy of my Church, or in other words, unto me--</p>
<p>38. For inasmuch as ye do it unto the least of these, ye do it unto me.</p>
<p>39. For it shall come to pass, that which I spake by the mouths of my prophets, shall be fulfilled; for I will consecrate of the riches of those who embrace my gospel among the Gentiles unto the poor of my people who are of the house of Israel.</p>
<p><a name="151" id="151"></a>[Page 151]</p>
<p>40. And again, thou shalt not be proud in thy heart; let all thy garments be plain, and their beauty the beauty of the work of thine own hands;</p>
<p>41. And let all things be done in cleanliness before me.</p>
<p>42. Thou shalt not be idle; for he that is idle shall not eat the bread nor wear the garments of the laborer.</p>
<p>43. And whosoever among you are sick, and have not faith to be healed, but believe, shall be nourished with all tenderness, with herbs and mild food, and that not by the hand of an enemy.</p>
<p>44. And the elders of the church, two or more, shall be called, and shall pray for and lay their hands upon them in my name; and if they die they shall die unto me, and if they live they shall live unto me.</p>
<p>45. Thou shalt live together in love, insomuch that thou shalt weep for the loss of them that die, and more especially for those that have not hope of a glorious resurrection.</p>
<p>46. And it shall come to pass that those that die in me, shall not taste of death, for it shall be sweet unto them;</p>
<p>47. And they that die not in me, wo unto them, for their death is bitter.</p>
<p>48. And again, it shall come to pass that he that hath faith in me to be healed, and is not appointed unto death, shall be healed.</p>
<p>49. He who hath faith to see shall see.</p>
<p>50. He who hath faith to hear shall hear.</p>
<p>51. The lame who hath faith to leap shall leap.</p>
<p>52. And they who have not faith to do these things, but believe in me, have power to become my sons; and inasmuch as they break not my laws thou shalt bear their infirmities.</p>
<p>53. Thou shalt stand in the place of thy stewardship.</p>
<p>54. Thou shalt not take thy brother's garment; thou shalt pay for that which thou shalt receive of thy brother.</p>
<p>55. And if thou obtainest more than that which would be for thy support; thou shalt give it into my store house, that all things may be done according to that which I have said.</p>
<p>56. Thou shalt ask, and my Scriptures shall be given as I have appointed, and they shall be preserved in safety;</p>
<p>57. And it is expedient that thou shouldst hold thy peace concerning them, and not teach them until ye have received them in full.</p>
<p>58. And I give unto you a commandment that then ye shall teach them unto all men; for they shall be taught unto all nations, kindreds, tongues and people.</p>
<p>59. Thou shalt take the things which thou hast received, which have been given unto thee in my Scriptures for a law, to be my law to govern my church;</p>
<p><a name="152" id="152"></a>[Page 152]</p>
<p>60. And he that doeth according to these things shall be saved, and he that doeth them not shall be damned, if he so continue.</p>
<p>61. If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge, that thou mayest know the mysteries and peaceable things--that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth life eternal.</p>
<p>62. Thou shalt ask, and it shall be revealed unto you in mine own due time where the New Jerusalem shall be built.</p>
<p>63. And behold, it shall come to pass that my servants shall be sent forth to the east and to the west, to the north and to the south.</p>
<p>64. And even now, let him that goeth to the east teach them that shall be converted to flee to the west, and this in consequence of that which is coming on the earth, and of secret combinations.</p>
<p>65. Behold, thou shalt observe all these things, and great shall be thy reward; for unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom, but unto the world it is not given to know them.</p>
<p>66. Ye shall observe the laws which ye have received and be faithful.</p>
<p>67. And ye shall hereafter receive church covenants, such as shall be sufficient to establish you, both here and in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>68. Therefore, he that lacketh wisdom, let him ask of me, and I will give him liberally and upbraid him not.</p>
<p>69. Lift up your hearts and rejoice, for unto you the kingdom, or in other words, the keys of the church have been given. Even so. Amen.</p>
<p>70. The priests and teachers shall have their stewardships, even as the members.</p>
<p>71. And the elders, or high priests, <a class="footnote" href="#fn-10">10</a> who are appointed to assist the bishop as counselors in all things, are to have their families supported out of the property which is consecrated to the bishop, for the good of the poor, and for other purposes, as before mentioned;</p>
<p class="MidQuote">72. Or they are to receive a just remuneration for all their services, either a stewardship or otherwise, as may be thought best or decided by the counselors and bishop.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">73. And the bishop, also, shall receive his support, or a just renumeration for all his services in the church.</p>

<p class="PageNo"><a name="153" id="153"></a>[Page 153]</p>
<p class="MidQuote">75. But if ye shall find that any persons have left their companions for the sake of adultery, and they themselves are the offenders, and their companions are living, they shall be cast out from among you.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">76. And again, I say unto you, that ye shall be watchful and careful, with all inquiry, that ye receive none such among you if they are married;</p>

<p><b>Pretentions of a Woman to Revelations, etc.</b></p>
<p>Soon after the foregoing revelation was received, a woman <a class="footnote" href="#fn-12">12</a> came making great pretensions of revealing commandments, laws and other curious matters; and as almost every person has advocates for both theory and practice, in the various notions and projects of the age, it became necessary to inquire of the Lord, when I received the following:</p>
<p class="Sub1">Revelation given at Kirtland, February, 1831. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-13">13</a></p>
<p class="MidQuote">1. O hearken, ye elders of my church, and give ear to the words which I shall speak unto you.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">2. For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye have received a commandment for a law unto my church, through him whom I have appointed unto you to receive commandments and revelations from my hand.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">3. And this ye shall know assuredly—that there is none other appointed unto you to receive commandments and revelations until he be taken, if he abide in me.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">4. But verily, verily, I say unto you, that none else shall be appointed unto this gift except it be through him; for if it be taken from him he shall not have power except to appoint another in his stead.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">5. And this shall be a law unto you, that ye receive not the teachings of any that shall come before you as revelations or commandments;</p>
<p class="MidQuote">6. And this I give unto you that you may not be deceived, that you may know they are not of me.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">7. For verily I say unto you, that he that is ordained of me shall come in at the gate and be ordained as I have told you before, to teach those revelations which you have received and shall receive through him whom I have appointed.</p>
<p class="PageNo"><a name="155" id="155"></a>[Page 155]</p>
<p class="MidQuote">8. And now, behold, I give unto you a commandment, that when ye are assembled together ye shall instruct and edify each other, that ye may know how to act and direct my church, how to act upon the points of my law and commandments, which I have given.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">9. And thus ye shall become instructed in the law of my church, and be sanctified by that which ye have received, and ye shall bind yourselves to act in all holiness before me—</p>
<p class="MidQuote">10. That inasmuch as ye do this, glory shall be added to the kingdom which ye have received. Inasmuch as ye do it not, it shall be taken, even that which ye have received.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">11. Purge ye out the iniquity which is among you; sanctify yourselves before me;</p>
<p class="MidQuote">12. And if ye desire the glories of the kingdom, appoint ye my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and uphold him before me by the prayer of faith.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">13. And again, I say unto you, that if ye desire the mysteries of the kingdom, provide for him food and raiment, and whatsoever thing he needeth to accomplish the work wherewith I have commanded him;</p>
<p class="MidQuote">14. And if ye do it not, he shall remain unto them that have received him, that I may reserve unto myself a pure people before me.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">15. Again I say, hearken ye elders of my church, whom I have appointed: Ye are not sent forth to be taught, but to teach the children of men the things which I have put into your hands by the power of my Spirit;</p>
<p class="MidQuote">16. And ye are to be taught from on high. Sanctify yourselves and ye shall be endowed with power, that ye may give even as I have spoken.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">17. Hearken ye, for, behold, the great day of the Lord is nigh at hand.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">18. For the day cometh that the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven; the heavens shall shake and the earth shall tremble, and the trump of God shall sound both long and loud, and shall say to the sleeping nations: Ye saints, arise and live; ye sinners, stay and sleep until I shall call again.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">19. Wherefore gird up your loins lest ye be found among the wicked.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">20. Lift up your voices and spare not. Call upon the nations to repent, both old and young, both bond and free, saying: Prepare yourselves for the great day of the Lord;</p>
<p class="MidQuote">21. For if I, who am a man, do lift up my voice and call upon you to repent, and ye hate me, what will ye say when the day cometh when the thunders shall utter their voices from the ends of the earth, speaking to the ears of all that live, saying—Repent, and prepare for the great day of the Lord?</p>
<p class="PageNo"><a name="156" id="156"></a>[Page 156]</p>
<p class="MidQuote">22. Yea, and again, when the lightnings shall streak forth from the east unto the west, and shall utter forth their voices unto all that live, and make the ears of all tingle that hear, saying these words—Repent ye, for the great day of the Lord is come?</p>
<p class="MidQuote">23. And again, the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven, saying: Hearken, O ye nations of the earth, and hear the words of that God who made you.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">24. O, ye nations of the earth, how often would I have gathered you together as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but ye would not!</p>
<p class="MidQuote">25. How oft have I called upon you by the mouth of my servants, and by the ministering of angels, and by mine own voice, and by the voice of thunderings, and by the voice of lightnings, and by the voice of tempests, and by the voice of earthquakes, and great hailstorms, and by the voice of famines and pestilences of every kind, and by the great sound of a trump, and by the voice of judgment, and by the voice of mercy all the day long, and by the voice of glory and honor and the riches of eternal life, and would have saved you with an everlasting salvation, but ye would not!</p>
<p class="MidQuote">26. Behold the day has come, when the cup of the wrath of mine indignation is full.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">27. Behold, verily I say unto you, that these are the words of the Lord your God.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">28. Wherefore, labor ye, labor ye in my vineyard for the last time—for the last time call upon the inhabitants of the earth.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">29. For in mine own due time will I come upon the earth in judgment, and my people shall be redeemed and shall reign with me on earth.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">30. For the great Millennium, of which I have spoken by the mouth of my servants, shall come.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">31. For Satan shall be bound, and when he is loosed again he shall only reign for a little season, and then cometh the end of the earth.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">32. And he that liveth in righteousness shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye, and the earth shall pass away so as by fire.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">33. And the wicked shall go away into unquenchable fire, and their end no man knoweth on earth, nor ever shall know, until they come before me in judgment.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">34. Hearken ye to these words. Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world. Treasure these things up in your hearts, and let the solemnities of eternity rest upon your minds.</p>
<p class="EndQuote">35. Be sober. Keep all my commandments. Even so. Amen.</p>
<p><b>A Special Conference, 3rd-6th of June.</b></p>
<p>The latter part of February I received the following revelation, which caused the Church to appoint a conference to be held early in the month of June ensuing:</p>
<p class="PageNo"><a name="157" id="157"></a>[Page 157]</p>
<p class="Sub1">Revelation to Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon, given at Kirtland, February, 1831. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-14">14</a></p>
<p class="MidQuote">1. Behold, thus saith the Lord unto you my servants, it is expedient in me that the elders of my church should be called together, from the east and from the west. and from the north and from the south, by letter or some other way.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">2. And it shall come to pass, that inasmuch as they are faithful, and exercise faith in me, I will pour out my Spirit upon them in the day that they assemble themselves together.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">3. And it shall come to pass that they shall go forth into the regions round about, and preach repentance unto the people.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">4. And many shall be converted, insomuch that ye shall obtain power to organize yourselves according to the laws of man:</p>
<p class="MidQuote">5. That your enemies may not have power over you; that you may be preserved in all things; that you may be enabled to keep my laws; that every bond may be broken wherewith the enemy seeketh to destroy my people.</p>
<p class="EndQuote">6. Behold, I say unto you, that ye must visit the poor and the needy and administer to their relief, that they may be kept until all things may be done according to my law which ye have received. Amen.</p>

<p class="Notes"><a class="fn" name="fn-4" target="_blank" id="fn-4"></a>4. Newel Kimball Whitney was descended from the Whitneys of Watertown, Mass., who emigrated from England in 1635. His mother was a native of the "Bay state," and his father of the state of Vermont. There, also, Newel was born, in Marlborough, Windham county, February 5, 1795. A natural business man, he made his own way in the world, and after figuring as a sutler during the war of 1812, and taking part in the battle of Plattsburgh, near Lake Champlain, he established himself as an Indian trader at Green Bay, Lake Michigan. He next settled in Ohio, where he made the acquaintance of Algernon Sidney Gilbert, a merchant of Painesville, whose partner he became in the successful firm of Gilbert and Whitney at Kirtland. In October, 1822, he married Elizabeth Ann Smith, a young lady from Connecticut, who is known in Church history as "Mother Whitney." When Oliver Cowdery and his fellow missionaries came to Kirtland, en route to Missouri, the Whitneys were Campbellites, members of Sidney Rigdon's flock, but upon hearing the fulness of the Gospel as preached by those Elders, they embraced it. In the Whitney family folk lore the incident of the Prophet's arrival at Kirtland is thus related: "About the first of February, 1831, a sleigh containing four persons drove through the streets of Kirtland and drew up in front of the store of Gilbert and Whitney. One of the men, a young and stalwart personage alighted, and springing up the steps walked into the store and to where the junior partner was standing. 'Newel K. Whitney! Thou art the man!' he exclaimed, extending his hand cordially, as if to an old and familiar acquaintance. 'You have the advantage of me,' replied the merchant, as he mechanically took the proffered hand, 'I could not call you by name as you have me.' 'I am Joseph the Prophet,' said the stranger smiling. 'You've prayed me here, now what do you want of me?'" The Prophet, it is said, while in the East had seen the Whitneys, in vision, praying for his coming to Kirtland. "Mother Whitney" also tells how on a certain night prior to the advent of Elder Cowdery and his companions, while she and her husband were praying to the Lord to know how they might obtain the gift of the Holy Ghost, which of all things they desired, they saw a vision as of a cloud of glory resting upon their house, and heard a voice from heaven saying, "Prepare to receive the word of the Lord, for it is coming." Shortly afterwards Oliver Cowdery and his associates came with the Book of Mormon, and with the message of the restored Gospel. Moreover, in further fulfilment of this vision, under the rooftree of the Whitneys the Prophet received a number of the revelations contained in this volume.</p>

This organization, called "the family," came into existence before the Gospel was preached in Kirtland, through an effort of the people of this neighborhood to live as the early Christians are said to have lived, viz., "And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things common."—(<a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/4.32?lang=eng#31" target="_blank">Acts 4:32.</a>)</p>

"She professed to be a prophetess of the Lord, and professed to have many revelations, and knew the Book of Mormon was true, and that she should become a teacher in the church of Christ. She appeared to be very sanctimonious and deceived some who were not able to detect her in her hypocrisy; others, however, had the spirit of discernment and her follies and abominations were manifest.
