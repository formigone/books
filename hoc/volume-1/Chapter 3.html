<p>The Nephite Record Delivered to Joseph--the Angel's Warning--the Work of Translation.</p>
<p>[Page 18]</p>
<p><strong>The Prophet Receives the Plates.</strong></p>
<p>At length the time arrived for obtaining the plates, the Urim and Thummim, and the Breastplate. On the twenty-second day of September, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-seven, having gone as usual at the end of another year to the place where they were deposited, the same heavenly messenger delivered them up to me with this charge: that I should be responsible for them; that if I should let them go carelessly, or through any neglect of mine, I should be cut off; but that if I would use all my endeavors to preserve them, until he, the messenger, should call for them, they should be protected.</p>
<p><strong>Efforts of Enemies to Get the Plates.</strong></p>
<p>I soon found out the reason why I had received such strict charges to keep them safe, and why it was that the messenger had said that when I had done what was required at my hand, he would call for them. For no sooner was it known that I had them, than the most strenuous exertions were used to get them from me. Every stratagem that could be invented was resorted to for that purpose. The persecution became more bitter and severe than before, and multitudes were on the alert continually to get them from me if possible. But by the wisdom of God, they remained safe in my hands, until I had accomplished by them what was required at my hand. When, according to arrangements, the messenger called for them, I delivered them up to him; and he has them in his charge until this day, being the second day of May, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-1">1</a></p>
<p><a name="19" id="19"></a>[Page 19]</p>
<p><strong>Misrepresentations.</strong></p>
<p>The excitement, however, still continued, and rumor with her thousand tongues was all the time employed in circulating falsehoods about my father's family, and about myself. If I were to relate a thousandth part of them, it would fill up volumes. The persecution, however, became so intolerable that I was under the necessity of leaving Manchester, and going with my wife to Susquehanna county, in the state of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><strong>Removal to Pennsylvania.</strong></p>
<p>While preparing to start,--being very poor, and the persecution so heavy upon us that there was no probability that we would ever be otherwise,--in the midst of our afflictions we found a friend in a gentleman by the name of Martin Harris, <a class="footnote" href="#fn-2">2</a> who came to us and gave me fifty dollars to assist us on our journey. Mr. Harris was a resident of Palmyra township, Wayne county, in the state of New York, and a farmer of respectability. By this timely aid was I enabled to reach the place of my destination in Pennsylvania; and immediately after my arrival there I commenced copying the characters off the plates. I copied a considerable number of them, and by means of the Urim and Thummim I translated some of them, which I did between the time I arrived at the house of my wife's father, in the month of December, and the February following.</p>
<p><strong>Words of the Book Given to the Learned.</strong></p>
<p><a name="20" id="20"></a>[Page 20]</p>
<p>Some time in this month of February, the aforementioned Mr. Martin Harris came to our place, got the characters which I had drawn off the plates, and started with them to the city of New York. For what took place relative to him and the characters, I refer to his own account of the circumstances, as he related them to me after his return, which was as follows:</p>
<p>I went to the city of New York, and presented the characters which had been translated, with the translation thereof, to Professor Charles Anthon, a gentleman celebrated for his literary attainments. Professor Anthon stated that the translation was correct, more so than any he had before seen translated from the Egyptian. I then showed him those which were not yet translated, and he said that they were Egyptian, Chaldaic, Assyric, and Arabic; and he said they were true characters. He gave me a certificate, certifying to the people of Palmyra that they were true characters, and that the translation of such of them as had been translated was also correct. I took the certificate and put it into my pocket, and was just leaving the house, when Mr. Anthon called me back, and asked me how the young man found out that there were gold plates in the place where he found them. I answered that an angel of God had revealed it unto him.</p>
<p>He then said to me, "Let me see that certificate." I accordingly took it out of my pocket and gave it to him, when he took it and tore it to pieces, saying, that there was no such thing now as ministering of angels, and that if I would bring the plates to him, he would translate them. I informed him that part of the plates were sealed, and that I was forbidden to bring them. He replied, "I cannot read a sealed book." I left him and went to Dr. Mitchell, who sanctioned what Professor Anthon had said respecting both the characters and the translation. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-3">3</a></p>
<p><strong>The Loss of 116 Pages of Manuscript.</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Harris, having returned from his tour, left me and went home to Palmyra, arranged his affairs, and returned again to my house about the 12th of April, 1828, and commenced writing for me while I translated from the plates, which we continued until the 14th of June following, by which time he had written one hundred and sixteen pages of manuscript on foolscap paper. Some time after Mr. Harris had begun to write for me, he began to importune me to give him liberty to carry the writings home and show them; and desired of me that I would inquire of the Lord, through the Urim and Thummim, if he might not do so. I did inquire, and the answer was that he must not. However, he was not satisfied with this answer, and desired that I should inquire again. I did so, and the answer was as before. Still he could not be contented, but insisted that I should inquire once more. After much solicitation I again inquired of the Lord, and permission was granted him to have the writings on certain conditions; which were, that he show them only to his brother, Preserved Harris, his own wife, his father and his mother, and a Mrs. Cobb, a sister to his wife. In accordance with this last answer, I required of him that he should bind himself in a covenant to me in a most solemn manner that he would not do otherwise than had been directed. He did so. He bound himself as I required of him, took the writings, and went his way. Notwithstanding, however, the great restrictions which he had been laid under, and the solemnity of the covenant which he had made with me, he did show them to others, and by stratagem they got them away from him, and they never have been recovered unto this day.</p>

<p><strong>Prophet's Journey to Manchester and Return to Pennsylvania.</strong></p>
<p>In the meantime, while Martin Harris was gone with the writings, I went to visit my father's family at Manchester. I continued there for a short season, and then returned to my place in Pennsylvania. Immediately after my return home, I was walking out a little distance, when, behold, the former heavenly messenger appeared and handed to me the Urim and Thummim again--for it had been taken from me in consequence of my having wearied the Lord in asking for the privilege of letting Martin Harris take the writings, which he lost by transgression--and I inquired of the Lord through it, and obtained the following:</p>
<p><a name="22" id="22"></a>[Page 22]</p>
<p>Revelation to Joseph Smith, Jun., given July, 1828, concerning certain manuscripts of the first part of the Book of Mormon, which had been taken from the possession of Martin Harris. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-4">4</a></p>
<p>1. The works, and the designs, and the purposes of God cannot be frustrated, neither can they come to naught.</p>
<p>2. For God doth not walk in crooked paths, neither doth he turn to the right hand nor to the left, neither doth he vary from that which he hath said, therefore his paths are straight, and his course is one eternal round.</p>
<p>3. Remember, remember that it is not the work of God that is frustrated, but the work of men;</p>
<p>4. For although a man may have many revelations, and have power to do many mighty works, yet if he boasts in his own strength, and sets at naught the counsels of God, and follows after the dictates of his own will and carnal desires, he must fall and incur the vengeance of a just God upon him.</p>
<p>5. Behold, you have been entrusted with these things, but how strict were your commandments; and remember also the promises which were made to you, if you did not transgress them.</p>
<p>6. And behold, how oft you have transgressed the commandments and the laws of God, and have gone on in the persuasions of men.</p>
<p>7. For, behold, you should not have feared man more than God. Although men set at naught the counsels of God, and despise his words--</p>
<p>8. Yet you should have been faithful and he would have extended his arm and supported you against all the fiery darts of the adversary; and he would have been with you in every time of trouble.</p>
<p>9. Behold, thou art Joseph, and thou wast chosen to do the work of the Lord, but because of transgression, if thou art not aware thou wilt fall.</p>
<p>10. But remember, God is merciful; therefore, repent of that which thou hast done which is contrary to the commandment which I gave you, and thou art still chosen, and art again called to the work;</p>
<p>11. Except thou do this, thou shalt be delivered up and become as other men and have no more gift.</p>
<p>12. And when thou deliveredst up that which God had given thee sight and power to translate, thou deliveredst up that which was sacred into the hands of a wicked man,</p>
<p>13. Who has set at naught the counsels of God, and has broken the most sacred promises which were made before God, and has depended upon his own judgment and boasted in his own wisdom.</p>
<p><a name="23" id="23"></a>[Page 23]</p>
<p>14. And this is the reason that thou hast lost thy privileges for a season--</p>
<p>15. For thou hast suffered the counsel of thy director to be trampled upon from the beginning.</p>
<p>16. Nevertheless, my work shall go forth, for inasmuch as the knowledge of a Savior has come into the world, through the testimony of the Jews, even so shall the knowledge of a Savior come unto my people--</p>
<p>17. And to the Nephites, and the Jacobites, and the Josephites, and the Zoramites, through the testimony of their fathers--</p>
<p>8. And this testimony shall come to the knowledge of the Lamanites, and the Lemuelites, and the Ishmaelites, who dwindled in unbelief because of the iniquity of their fathers, whom the Lord has suffered to destroy their brethren the Nephites, because of their iniquities and their abominations.</p>
<p>19. And for this very purpose are these plates preserved which contain these records--that the promises of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he made to his people;</p>
<p>20. And that the Lamanites might come to the knowledge of their fathers, and that they might know the promises of the Lord, and that they may believe the gospel and rely upon the merits of Jesus Christ, and be glorified through faith in his name, and that through their repentance they might be saved. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>Interpreters and Plates Returned to the Prophet.</strong></p>
<p>After I had obtained the above revelation, both the plates and the Urim and Thummim were taken from me again; but in a few days they were returned to me, when I inquired of the Lord, and the Lord said thus unto me: <a class="footnote" href="#fn-5">5</a></p>
<p>Revelation, given to Joseph Smith, Jun., informing him of the alteration of the manuscript of the fore part of the Book of Mormon. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-6">6</a></p>
<p>1. Now, behold, I say unto you, that because you delivered up those writings which you had power given unto you to translate by the means of the Urim and Thummim, into the hands of a wicked man, you have lost them.</p>
<p><a name="24" id="24"></a>[Page 24]</p>
<p>2. And you also lost your gift at the same time, and your mind became darkened.</p>
<p>3. Nevertheless, it is now restored unto you again; therefore see that you are faithful and continue on unto the finishing of the remainder of the work of translation as you have begun.</p>
<p>4. Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength and means provided to enable you to translate; but be diligent unto the end:</p>
<p>5. Pray always, that you may come off conqueror; yea, that you may conquer Satan, and that you may escape the hands of the servants of Satan that do uphold his work.</p>
<p>6. Behold, they have sought to destroy you; yea, even the man in whom you have trusted has sought to destroy you.</p>
<p>7. And for this cause I said that he is a wicked man, for he has sought to take away the things wherewith you have been entrusted; and he has also sought to destroy your gift.</p>
<p>8. And because you have delivered the writings into his hands, behold, wicked men have taken them from you.</p>
<p>9. Therefore, you have delivered them up, yea, that which was sacred, unto wickedness.</p>
<p>10. And, behold, Satan hath put it into their hearts to alter the words which you have caused to be written, or which you have translated, which have gone out of your hands.</p>
<p>11. And behold, I say unto you, that because they have altered the words, they read contrary from that which you translated and caused to be written;</p>
<p>12. And, on this wise, the devil has sought to lay a cunning plan, that he may destroy this work;</p>
<p>13. For he hath put it into their hearts to do this, that by lying they may say they have caught you in the words which you have pretended to translate.</p>
<p>14. Verily, I say unto you, that I will not suffer that Satan shall accomplish his evil design in this thing.</p>
<p>15. For behold, he has put it into their hearts to get thee to tempt the Lord thy God in asking to translate it over again.</p>
<p>16. And then, behold, they say and think in their hearts--We will see if God has given him power to translate; if so, he will also give him power again;</p>
<p>17. And if God giveth him power again, or if he translates again, or, in other words, if he bringeth forth the same words, behold, we have the same with us, and we have altered them;</p>
<p>18. Therefore they will not agree, and we will say that he has lied in his words, and that he has no gift, and that he has no power:</p>
<p><a name="25" id="25"></a>[Page 25]</p>
<p>19. Therefore we will destroy him, and also the work; and we will do this that we may not be ashamed in the end, and that we may get glory of the world.</p>
<p>20. Verily, verily, I say unto you, that Satan has great hold upon their hearts; he stirreth them up to iniquity against that which is good;</p>
<p>21. And their hearts are corrupt, and full of wickedness and abominations; and they love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil: therefore they will not ask of me.</p>
<p>22. Satan stirreth them up, that he may lead their souls to destruction.</p>
<p>23. And thus he has laid a cunning plan, thinking to destroy the work of God; but I will require this at their hands, and it shall turn to their shame and condemnation in the day of judgment.</p>
<p>24. Yea, he stirreth up their hearts to anger against this work.</p>
<p>25. Yea, he saith unto them: Deceive and lie in wait to catch, that ye may destroy; behold, this is no harm. And thus he flattereth them, and telleth them that it is no sin to lie that they may catch a man in a lie, that they may destroy him.</p>
<p>26. And thus he flattereth them, and leadeth them along until he draggeth their souls down to hell; and thus he causeth them to catch themselves in their own snare.</p>
<p>27. And thus he goeth up and down, to and fro in the earth, seeking to destroy the souls of men.</p>
<p>28. Verily, verily, I say unto you, woe be unto him that lieth to deceive because he supposeth that another lieth to deceive, for such are not exempt from the justice of God.</p>
<p>29. Now, behold, they have altered these words, because Satan saith unto them; He hath deceived you--and thus he flattereth them away to do iniquity, to get thee to tempt the Lord thy God.</p>
<p>30. Behold, I say unto you, that you shall not translate again those words which have gone forth out of your hands;</p>
<p>31. For, behold, they shall not accomplish their evil designs in lying against those words. For, behold, if you should bring forth the same words they will say that you have lied and that you have pretended to translate, but that you have contradicted yourself.</p>
<p>32. And, behold, they will publish this, and Satan will harden the hearts of the people to stir them up to anger against you, that they will not believe my words.</p>
<p>33. Thus Satan thinketh to overpower your testimony in this generation, that the work may not come forth in this generation.</p>
<p>34. But behold, here is wisdom, and because I show unto you wisdom, and give you commandments concerning these things, what you shall do, show it not unto the world until you have accomplished the work of translation.</p>
<p>35. Marvel not that I said unto you; Here is wisdom, show it not unto the world--for I said, show it not unto the world, that you may be preserved.</p>
<p><a name="26" id="26"></a>[Page 26]</p>
<p>36. Behold, I do not say that you shall not show it unto the righteous;</p>
<p>37. But as you cannot always judge the righteous, or as you cannot always tell the wicked from the righteous, therefore I say unto you, hold your peace until I shall see fit to make all things known unto the world concerning the matter.</p>
<p>38. And now, verily I say unto you, that an account of those things that you have written, which have gone out of your hands, is engraven upon the plates of Nephi;</p>
<p>39. Yea, and you remember it was said in those writings that a more particular account was given of these things upon the plates of Nephi.</p>
<p>40. And now, because the account which is engraven upon the plates of Nephi is more particular concerning the things which, in my wisdom, I would bring to the knowledge of the people in this account--</p>
<p>41. Therefore, you shall translate the engravings which are on the plates of Nephi, down even till you come to the reign of King Benjamin, or until you come to that which you have translated, which you have retained;</p>
<p>42. And behold, you shall publish it as the record of Nephi; and thus I will confound those who have altered my words.</p>
<p>43. I will not suffer that they shall destroy my work; yea, I will show unto them that my wisdom is greater than the cunning of the devil.</p>
<p>44. Behold, they have only got a part, or an abridgment of the account of Nephi.</p>
<p>45. Behold, there are many things engraven upon the plates of Nephi which do throw greater views upon my gospel; therefore, it is wisdom in me that you should translate this first part of the engravings of Nephi, and send forth in this work.</p>
<p>46. And behold, all the remainder of this work does contain all those parts of my gospel which my holy prophets, yea, and also my disciples, desired in their prayers should come forth unto this people.</p>
<p>47. And I said unto them, that it should be granted unto them according to their faith in their prayers;</p>
<p>48. Yea, and this was their faith--that my gospel, which I gave unto them that they might preach in their days, might come unto their brethren the Lamanites, and also all that had become Lamanites because of their dissensions.</p>
<p>49. Now, this is not all--their faith in their prayers was that this gospel should be made known also, if it were possible that other nations should possess this land;</p>
<p><a name="27" id="27"></a>[Page 27]</p>
<p>50. And thus they did leave a blessing upon this land in their prayers, that whosoever should believe in this gospel in this land might have eternal life;</p>
<p>51. Yea, that it might be free unto all of whatsoever nation, kindred, tongue, or people they may be.</p>
<p>52. And now, behold, according to their faith in their prayers will I bring this part of my gospel to the knowledge of my people. Behold, I do not bring it to destroy that which they have received, but to build it up.</p>
<p>53. And for this cause have I said: If this generation harden not their hearts, I will establish my church among them.</p>
<p>54. Now I do not say this to destroy my church, but I say this to build up my church;</p>
<p>55. Therefore, whosoever belongeth to my church need not fear, for such shall inherit the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>56. But it is they who do not fear me, neither keep my commandments but build up churches unto themselves to get gain, yea, and all those that do wickedly and build up the kingdom of the devil--yea, verily, verily, I say unto you, that it is they that I will disturb, and cause to tremble and shake to the center.</p>
<p>57. Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I came unto mine own, and mine own received me not.</p>
<p>58. I am the light which shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not.</p>
<p>59. I am he who said--Other sheep have I which are not of this fold--unto my disciples, and many there were that understood me not.</p>
<p>60. And I will show unto this people that I had other sheep, and that they were a branch of the house of Jacob;</p>
<p>61. And I will bring to light their marvelous works, which they did in my name;</p>
<p>62. Yea, and I will also bring to light my gospel which was ministered unto them, and, behold, they shall not deny that which you have received, but they shall build it up, and shall bring to light the true points of my doctrine, yea, and the only doctrine which is in me.</p>
<p>63. And this I do that I may establish my gospel, that there may not be so much contention; yea, Satan doth stir up the hearts of the people to contention concerning the points of my doctrine; and in these things they do err, for they do wrest the scriptures and do not understand them.</p>
<p>64. Therefore, I will unfold unto them this great mystery;</p>
<p>65. For, behold, I will gather them as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, if they will not harden their hearts;</p>
<p>66. Yea, if they will come, they may, and partake of the waters of life freely.</p>
<p><a name="28" id="28"></a>[Page 28]</p>
<p>67. Behold, this is my doctrine--whosoever repenteth and cometh unto me, the same is my church.</p>
<p>68. Whosoever declareth more or less than this, the same is not of me, but is against me, therefore he is not of my church.</p>
<p>69. And now, behold, whosoever is of my church, and endureth of my church to the end, him will I establish upon my rock, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against them.</p>
<p>70. And now, remember the words of him who is the life and light of the world, your Redeemer, your Lord and your God. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>Interval in the Work of Translation.</strong></p>
<p>I did not, however, go immediately to translating, but went to laboring with my hands upon a small farm which I had purchased of my wife's father, in order to provide for my family. In the month of February, 1829, my father came to visit us, at which time I received the following revelation for him:</p>
<p>Revelation to Joseph Smith, Sen., given February, 1829. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-7">7</a></p>
<p>1. Now behold, a marvelous work is about to come forth among the children of men.</p>
<p>2. Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day.</p>
<p>3. Therefore, if ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work;</p>
<p>4. For behold the field is white already to harvest; and lo, he that thrusteth in his sickle with his might, the same layeth up in store that he perisheth not, but bringeth salvation to his soul;</p>
<p>5. And faith, hope, charity and love, with an eye single to the glory of God, qualify him for the work.</p>
<p>6. Remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence.</p>
<p>7. Ask, and ye shall receive, knock, and it shall be opened unto you. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>Three Witnesses Promised.</strong></p>
<p>The following I applied for and obtained, at the request of the aforementioned Martin Harris:</p>
<p><strong>Revelation, given March, 1829.</strong> <a class="footnote" href="#fn-8">8</a></p>
<p>1. Behold, I say unto you, that as my servant Martin Harris has desired a witness at my hand, that you, my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., have got the plates of which you have testified and borne record that you have received of me;</p>
<p><a name="29" id="29"></a>[Page 29]</p>
<p>2. And now, behold, this shall you say unto him,--He who spake unto you, said unto you: I, the Lord, am God, and have given these things unto you, my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and have commanded you that you should stand as a witness of these things;</p>
<p>3. And I have caused you that you should enter into a covenant with me, that you should not show them except to those persons to whom I commanded you; and you have no power over them except I grant it unto you.</p>
<p>4. And you have a gift to translate the plates; and this is the first gift that I bestowed upon you; and I have commanded that you should pretend to no other gift until my purpose is fulfilled in this; for I will grant unto you no other gift until it is finished.</p>
<p>5. Verily, I say unto you, that woe shall come unto the inhabitants of the earth if they will not hearken unto my words;</p>
<p>6. For hereafter you shall be ordained and go forth and deliver my words unto the children of men.</p>
<p>7. Behold, if they will not believe my words, they would not believe you, my servant Joseph, if it were possible that you should show them all these things which I have committed unto you.</p>
<p>8. Oh, this unbelieving and stiffnecked generation--mine anger is kindled against them.</p>
<p>9. Behold, verily I say unto you, I have reserved those things which I have entrusted unto you, my servant Joseph, for a wise purpose in me, and it shall be made known unto future generations;</p>
<p>10. But this generation shall have my word through you;</p>
<p>11. And in addition to your testimony, the testimony of three of my servants, whom I shall call and ordain, unto whom I will show these things, and they shall go forth with my words that are given through you.</p>
<p>12. Yea, they shall know of a surety that these things are true, for from heaven will I declare it unto them.</p>
<p>13. I will give them power that they may behold and view these things as they are;</p>
<p>14. And to none else will I grant this power, to receive this same testimony among this generation, in this the beginning of the rising up and the coming forth of my Church out of the wilderness--clear as the moon, and fair as the sun, and terrible as an array with banners.</p>
<p>15. And the testimony of three witnesses will I send forth of my word.</p>
<p>16. And behold, whosoever believeth on my words, them will I visit with the manifestation of my Spirit; and they shall be born of me, even of water and of the Spirit--</p>
<p><a name="30" id="30"></a>[Page 30]</p>
<p>17. And you must wait yet a little while, for ye are not yet ordained--</p>
<p>18. And their testimony shall also go forth unto the condemnation of this generation if they harden their hearts against them;</p>
<p>19. For a desolating scourge shall go forth among the inhabitants of the earth, and shall continue to be poured out from time to time, if they repent not, until the earth is empty, and the inhabitants thereof are consumed away and utterly destroyed by the brightness of my coming.</p>
<p>20. Behold, I tell you these things, even as I also told the people of the destruction of Jerusalem; and my word shall be verified at this time as it hath hitherto been verified.</p>
<p>21. And now I command you, my servant Joseph, to repent and walk more uprightly before me, and to yield to the persuasions of men no more;</p>
<p class="MidQuote">22. And that you be firm in keeping the commandments wherewith I have commanded you; and if you do this, behold I grant unto you eternal life, even if you should be slain.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">23. And now, again, I speak unto you, my servant Joseph, concerning the man that desires the witness—</p>
<p class="MidQuote">24. Behold, I say unto him, he exalts himself and does not humble himself sufficiently before me; but if he will bow down before me, and humble himself in mighty prayer and faith, in the sincerity of his heart, then will I grant unto him a view of the things which he desires to see.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">25. And then he shall say unto the people of this generation: Behold, I have seen the things which the Lord hath shown unto Joseph Smith, Jun., and I know of a surety that they are true, for I have seen them, for they have been shown unto me by the power of God and not of man.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">26. And I the Lord commanded him, my servant Martin Harris, that he shall say no more unto them concerning these things, except he shall say: I have seen them, and they have been shown unto me by the power of God; and these are the words which he shall say.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">27. But if he deny this he will break the covenant which he has before covenanted with me, and behold, he is condemned.</p>
<p class="MidQuote">28. And now, except he humble himself and acknowledge unto me the things that he has done which are wrong, and covenant with me that he will keep my commandments, and exercise faith in me, behold, I say unto him, he shall have no such views, for I will grant unto him no views of the things of which I have spoken.</p>

Martin Harris, who subsequently became one of the Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon, was born in East-town, Saratoga county, New York, on the 18th of May, 1783. When in his ninth year his father moved with his family into Palmyra, Wayne county, so that man and boy Martin Harris had lived in Palmyra some thirty-six years. He had amassed a considerable property in lands, and had established a reputation for business reliability.</p>

Howe, of Painesville, Ohio, who published a book against the Church in 1834, Professor Anthon acknowledged the visit of Martin Harris to him and the presentation of the characters in question. He states, however, that Harris, whom he describes as "a plain, apparently simple-hearted farmer," presented him with a note from Dr. Samuel L. Mitchell, of New York, requesting him (Anthon) to decipher, if possible, a paper which the "farmer" would hand to him. The call on Dr. Mitchell, alluded to in Martin Harris' statement above, must, therefore, have referred to a second visit to Dr. Mitchell, after his adventure with Professor Anthon. The latter's communication to Howe bears the date of February 17th, 1834, and is published in <i>extenso</i> in Smucker's <i>History of the Mormons,</i> pp. 37-39.</p>
