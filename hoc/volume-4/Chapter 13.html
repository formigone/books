<p><em>Wednesday 28.</em>--[On this date a long communication was sent to the editors of the <em>Times and Seasons</em> signed by Heber C. Kimball, Wilford Woodruff and George A. Smith, detailing their visit to various places in London, but as the communication does not in any way bear upon the incidents of the history of the Church, it is thought unnecessary to publish the letter <em>in extenso.</em> The following paragraph from the letter, however, it is thought should be preserved, because it refers to the liberty the Elders of the Church incidentally enjoyed while engaged in the ministry; and also because it breathes that spirit of liberty in the pursuit of knowledge characteristic of the work of God in the last days.--Editors.]</p>

<p>We consider it perfectly consistent with our calling, with reason and revelation that we should form a knowledge of kingdoms and countries whether at home or abroad, whether ancient or modern, whether of things past or present or to come; whether it be in heaven, earth or hell, air or seas; or whether we obtain this knowledge by being local or traveling, by study or by faith, by dreams or by visions, by revelation or by prophecy, it mattereth not unto us; if we can but obtain a correct [view of] principles, and knowledge of things as they are, in their true light, past, present and to come. It is under such a view of things that we are endeavoring to avail ourselves of every opportunity in our travels among the nations of the earth, to record an account of things as they pass under our observation.</p>
<p><em>Thursday, 29.</em>--Elder Woodruff preached twice in London, and baptized three.</p>
<p><em>Friday, 30.</em>--Elder Lorenzo Snow had a discussion with Mr. Barker, a Methodist minister, at Hill Top, near Birmingham, and baptized two.</p>
<p><em>Sunday, 31.</em>--I copy the following from the <em>Manx Liberal</em> of this date:</p>
<p>Mormonism in the Isle of Man.</p>
<p><em>To the Editor of the Manx Liberal:</em></p>
<p>Sir--I feel rather surprised and chagrined that the modern delusion, viz., "Mormonism," should have made such rapid strides in this town, hitherto considered exempt from the many systems of irreligious creeds which abound in England, America, and elsewhere. I had thought that the powerful and argumentative addresses of the dissenting ministers would have checked such a gross piece of imposition in its infancy, and thus prevented the great mass of our town's people from becoming dupes of designing knaves, "and being led away by every wind of doctrine." Above all, I imagined the two pamphlets issued by that holy, religious and devout man of God, Mr. Hays, Wesleyan minister, (to which connection I have the happiness and honor to belong) would have been quite sufficient to prove the fallacy of such a system, and prevent its further spread. But, sir, alas! alas! the case is quite the reverse; numbers continually flock to the Wellington room, and listen with eagerness to the principles there advocated. The members of our society (Methodists) seem to be most conspicuous in sanctioning and promoting this vile and abominable doctrine.</p>
<p><a name="235" id="235"></a>[Page 235]</p>
<p>Oh, sir, the result to our connection will be dreadful! the havoc tremendous; just think of the majority of our <em>leading</em> and intelligent men aiding and abetting a cause of this description! Oh, sir, lamentable and heart-rending to witness the beaming countenances, and smiles of approbation displayed recently at Taylor's meeting! I could enumerate a host of our members who regularly attend those anti-Christian meetings; but I will just mention, with your permission, the names of a few who attended one of the last meetings. (Here followed a list of names.)</p>
<p>O! Mr. Editor! I quake for the consequence; such a wholesale conversion to Mormonism was never before witnessed in any town or country. What will become of our society? What will become of our class meetings? What will become of our brethren in the faith? And above all, what will become of poor Mr. Hays <a class="footnote" href="#fn-1">1</a> that nice and humble man, who so nobly stood forward to expose the errors of the Mormon system; God bless him and preserve him from want! But, Mr. Editor, what makes the case worse is, that a rumor is prevalent that all these pious men are to be baptized! That is duly immersed in the salt water of Douglas Bay, by that abominable creature, Taylor! Surely, there must be something enchanting about the vile man. Immersion! (my hand shakes while I write) and in winter, too! Oh, sir! the thought chills my very soul; surely this American dipper intends to drown them; he can have no other object in view, therefore, brethren of the Methodist society, beware! Drowning is not to be envied, and that too in your sins. Besides, what would the venerable John Wesley, (if he were alive) say to such conduct? What will the conference say? And what will the world say? I leave these questions to yourselves to answer. In conclusion, brethren, I recommend you to read, mark, learn and inwardly digest the things which belong to your eternal peace, and listen no longer to the follies of men.</p>

<p><strong>Excommuncation of Sidney Roberts.</strong></p>
<p>There was a conference in New York City, Elder Orson Hyde presiding. The revelations of Elder Sidney Roberts were objected to, which were that a certain brother must give him a suit of clothes, and a gold watch, the best that could be had, also his saluting the sisters with holy kiss. Elder Roberts justified himself in these things. Much good counsel was given him, but he said he knew the revelations he had received were from God, and would make no confession; consequently the conference cut him off, and demanded his license, which he refused to give up.</p>
<p>Elder John Taylor has been preaching and baptizing for some time in the Isle of Man, where the work is now progressing.</p>

<p>Beloved Brethren--I have just returned from a walk with Brothers Kimball and Woodruff. We have only been as far as St. Paul's and returned by Smithfield Market about three miles. Brother Kimball and myself had fine weather for our journey here; it was a beautiful day that we left Macclesfield for Burslem. We found the brethren in Macclesfield in good spirits, and in a good state as to appearance. They appear to be well suited with Brother James Galley; I think he will be a useful man in this kingdom. We found Brother George A. Smith in Burslem, not in the best of health. He is like the rest of us, the climate does not agree with him; he is affected with a bleeding at the lungs. We stayed with him at the Potteries. I preached two evenings. The Church is in a good state; some of the members have a pretty hard time of it. Brother Smith will stay there for the present.</p>
<p><a name="238" id="238"></a>[Page 238]</p>
<p>Saturday, 28th, left for the next stopping place in Grets Green, where we spent the Sabbath. On Saturday evening we called to see Sister Roden, Father Patrick's daughter; she was very glad to see us, and wanted we should stay all night. Her husband was very kind to us, and bid us or other Elders welcome to his house at any time. We could not stay; took tea with them, and agreed to send Elder Lorenzo Snow there if he could come; blessed them, and left them. I preached in the morning to the Saints in Grets Green, stayed afternoon meeting, and then walked to Birmingham; was very tired; heard Elder Snow preach; he is a nice young man, I think. Brother Kimball also spoke to the people after Brother Snow had got through. We found Brother Robert Williams here; he opened the meeting; he seems to be full of the Spirit.</p>
<p>On Monday at 12 o'clock, Brother Kimball and myself took the railway. Brother Williams started on foot for London. We arrived here on Monday evening about six o'clock; found Brother Woodruff well and in good spirits. We have been pretty busy since we have been here.</p>

<p>A great part of the city of Messina, Sicily, was this day destroyed by an earthquake. Such was the force of the first shock that the inhabitants of the town were buried in an instant beneath the ruins.</p>

<p>John C. Bennett who had been delegated to Springfield to carry our petition for a City Charter, announced the passage of the bill, as follows--</p>
<p>Letter of John C. Bennett to the "Times and Seasons"--Announcing the passage of the act incorporating Nauvoo.</p>
<p>City Of Springfield, December 16, 1840.</p>
<p><em>Editors of the Times and Seasons:</em></p>
<p>The act incorporating the city of Nauvoo has just passed the council of revision, and is now a law of the land, to take effect and be in force from and after the first Monday in February next. The aforesaid act contains two additional charters--one incorporating the "Nauvoo Legion," the other the"University of the city of Nauvoo."</p>
<p>All these charters are very broad and liberal, conferring the most plenary powers on the corporators. Illinois has acquitted herself with honor, and her state legislators shall never be forgotten. Every power we asked has been granted, every request gratified, every desire fulfilled. In the senate Mr. Little cancelled every obligation to our people, and faithfully, and honestly, and with untiring diligence, discharged every obligation devolving upon him as our immediate representative in the Upper House. Mark well that man, and do him honor. Snyder, and Ralston, and Moore, and Ross, and Stapp, and numerous others, likewise in that branch of our state government, rendered as very essential services; and the act passed that body without a dissenting voice.</p>
<p>In the House of Representatives, Charles, our immediate Representative in the Lower House, was at his post and discharged his duty as a faithful representative; he is an acting, and not a talking man, and has fulfilled all his obligations to us. Many members in this house, likewise, were warmly in our favor; and with only one or two dissenting voices, every representative appeared inclined to extend to us all such powers as they considered us justly entitled to, and voted for the law; and here I should not forget to mention, that Lincoln, <a href="https://byustudies-dev.byu.edu/hc/4/14.html#fn-2">2</a>whose name we erased from the electoral ticket in November (not however on account of any dislike to him as a man, but simply because his was the last name on the ticket, and we desired to show our friendship to the Democratic party by substituting the name of Ralston for some one of the Whigs) had the magnanimity to vote for our act, and came forward, after the final vote to the bar of the house, and cordially congratulated me on its passage.</p>
<p><a name="249" id="249"></a>[Page 249]</p>
<p>Our worthy governor is certainly disposed to do us ample justice in every respect, and to extend to us every facility for our future happiness and prosperity.</p>
<p>Illinois has certainly done her duty, and her whole duty; and now it becomes us to show ourselves upright, honest, just, worthy of the favors bestowed by noble, generous, and magnanimous statesmen, I have said that we are a law-abiding people, and we must now show it. The state has washed her hands in granting all our petitions, and if we do not now show ourselves approved, the curse must fall upon our own heads. Justice, equal justice, should be our fixed object and purpose, and the Great God will prosper us; length of days will be in our right hand, and in our left, glory and honor.</p>
<p>Yours, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>John C. Bennett.</p>
<p>The City Charter of Nauvoo is of my own plan and device. I concocted it for the salvation of the Church, and on principles so broad, that every honest man might dwell secure under its protective influence without distinction of sect or party.</p>

Thomas Hamilton, whom he met in a public debate and easily vanquished."No great honor, however," says Elder Taylor in his account of the affair,"as he was a very ignorant man." Elder Taylor secured for his meeting place the Wellington rooms, and from the platform he answered all who opposed him, and succeeded, despite all opposition, in organizing a branch of the Church in Douglas.</p>
