<p>Affairs in Kirtland and Nauvoo--Epistle of the Twelve to the Saints in the British Islands--Orson Hyde's Prayer on the Mount of Olives, Dedicating the Holy Land Preparatory to the Return of the Tribes of Israel.</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, October 20, 1841.</em>--The following extract of a letter from Elder Hyde, dated Jaffa, October 20, 1841, on his way to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Extract from Orson Hyde's Letter.</p>
<p>On my passage from Beyrut to this place (Jaffa) night before last, at one o'clock, as I was meditating on the deck of the vessel, as she was beating down against a sultry wind, a very bright glittering sword appeared in the heavens, about six feet in length, with a beautiful hilt, as plain and complete as any cut you ever saw; and what is still more remarkable, an arm with a perfect hand stretched itself out, and took hold of the hilt of the sword. The appearance really made my hair rise, and the flesh, as it were, crawl on my bones. The Arabs made a wonderful outcry at the sight. Allah! Allah! Allah! [O Lord, O Lord, O Lord] was their exclamation all over the vessel. I mention this because you know there is a commandment of God for me, which says, "Unto you it shall be given to know the signs of the times, and the sign of the coming of the Son of Man."</p>
<p>Yours in Christ,</p>
<p>Orson Hyde.</p>
<p><em>Saturday, 23.</em>--I attended the city council.</p>
<p>Minutes of Conference held at Lima.</p>
<p>Lima [Adams county, Illinois] conference convened pursuant to previous appointment. Elders Brigham Young, John Taylor, and Willard Richards, of the Twelve Apostles, were in attendance. Elder Brigham Young was unanimously chosen president, and James C. Snow, clerk of the conference.</p>
<p><a name="440" id="440"></a>[Page 440]</p>
<p>President Young then made some preliminary remarks, setting forth and explaining the object of the meeting; followed by President Isaac Morley. Elder James C. Snow then represented the branch of the Church at Lima, consisting of 424 members, including 9 High Priests, 32 Elders, 4 Priests, 5 Teachers, and 4 Deacons, mostly in good standing.</p>
<p>President Young, Elders Taylor and Richards, then made some very appropriate remarks, showing and proving the absolute necessity of finishing and completing the House of the Lord now building in Nauvoo, in preference to anything else that can be done, either by mental or physical exertion, in spreading light, knowledge, and intelligence among the nations of the earth.</p>
<p>Conference adjourned till tomorrow, ten o'clock.</p>
<p>In the evening President Morley met with his counselors together with President Young, Elders Taylor, and Richards, and brethren of the Lima branch, for the purpose of entering into certain resolutions necessary, in order to become more active in forwarding the work on the House of the Lord.</p>
<p>After much deliberation, it was moved and seconded, that all those who are willing to consecrate one tenth of their time and property to the building of the temple at Nauvoo, under the superintendence of President Morley and counselors, to signify it by the uplifted hands; when the motion was carried unanimously.</p>
<p>Sunday morning, at ten o'clock conference met pursuant to adjournment.</p>
<p>Elder John Taylor delivered an address, upon the object of Christ's mission into this world, the resurrection and redemption of the Saints, and pointed out very clearly the course to be pursued in order to become the sons of God, through the ordinances of the gospel, that the Saints may, at last, be exalted at the right hand of God, to dwell with Him eternally in the heavens.</p>
<p>After an intermission of one hour, the sacrament was administered by President Young and Elder Richards. The minutes of the conference were then read and accepted.</p>
<p>President Young made some very just remarks on the priesthood, authority, and calling.</p>
<p>Conference adjourned <em>sine die.</em></p>
<p>Benediction by President Morley.</p>
<p>Brigham Young, President,</p>

<p>Extract of a Letter from Parley P. Pratt--Emigration of Saints, and Status of the Work in England.</p>
<p>Manchester, England.</p>
<p>On the 20th of September, the ship <em>Tyrean</em> sailed from Liverpool for New Orleans, under a charter of the Latter-day Saints; she had upwards of two hundred Saints on board, with Elder Joseph Fielding at their head. By chartering [the vessel] we saved the company [of Saints] at least 500 or 600 dollars. The splendid new ship <em>Chaos,</em> 1,200 tons burthen, will sail on the 5th of November, under our charter. She will have from one to two hundred Saints on board, with Patriarch Peter Melling at their head.</p>
<p>The Saints in this country are generally rejoicing, and filled with the testimony of Jesus. Great zeal is manifested by the officers in general, of whom there are probably more than a thousand. We are increasing in numbers, and in gifts and blessings. New branches of the Church are rising in many places, and great additions made to the old ones. Manchester and vicinity has poured forth a stream of emigration for the last eighteen months, and still we numbered at our conference, two weeks ago, nearly sixteen hundred members, and between one and two hundred officers; all these within one hour's journey of Manchester.</p>
<p>There has been a general time of pruning; we have cut off upwards of one hundred members from this conference in a few months; this causes the young and tender branches to grow with double vigor.</p>

<p>Copy of a Letter of Attorney from Joseph Smith, "Sole Trustee in Trust for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints," to Reuben McBride, of Kirtland, Ohio.</p>

<p>In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal this 28th day of October, 1841.</p>
<p>Joseph Smith, (L. S.)</p>
<p>Witness: John Taylor, John S. Fullmer.</p>
<p><em>Friday, 29.</em>--Those of the Twelve Apostles who were in Nauvoo, met in council.</p>
<p><em>Saturday, 30.</em>--I attended the city council, and spoke against the council remitting a fine assessed against John Eagle by a jury of twelve men, considering that the jury might be as sensible men as any of the city council, and I asked the council not to remit the fine.</p>
<p>Lyman Wight, Willard Richards, and Wilford Woodruff were elected councilors, and Hiram Kimball and George W. Harris, Aldermen.</p>
<p>In obedience to an order from the mayor, I called out two companies of the Nauvoo Legion, and removed a grog shop kept by Pulaski S. Cahoon, which had been declared a nuisance by the city council.</p>
<p><em>Sunday, 31.</em>--I was in council with the brethren at brother Hyrum's office.</p>
<p><a name="443" id="443"></a>[Page 443]</p>
<p>Attended a council with the Twelve Apostles. Benjamin Winchester being present, complained that he had been neglected and misrepresented by the Elders, and manifested a contentious spirit. I gave him a severe reproof, telling him of his folly and vanity, and showing him that the principles which he suffered to control him would lead him to destruction. I counseled him to change his course, govern his disposition, and quit his tale-bearing and slandering his brethren.</p>
<p>I instructed the council on many principles pertaining to the gathering of the nations, the wickedness and downfall of this generation, &amp;c.</p>
<p>After having received the following minutes--"A conference was held at Kirtland, Ohio, Oct. 2, 1841. Almon W. Babbitt, president, and William W. Phelps, clerk. Resolved, that Thomas Burdick, Bishop of Kirtland, and his counselors, be constituted a company to establish a press in Kirtland, and publish a religious paper, entitled <em>The Olive Leaf,</em> and that the Saints adjacent be solicited to carry the above resolution into effect"--my brother Hyrum wrote to the brethren in Kirtland, of which the following is an extract--</p>
<p>Excerpt of Hyrum Smith's Letter to the Saints in Kirtland--Disapproving of Certain Plans for Building up Kirtland.</p>
<p>All the Saints that dwell in that land are commanded to come away, for this is "Thus saith the Lord;" therefore pay out no moneys, nor properties for houses, nor lands in that country, for if you do you will lose them, for the time shall come, that you shall not possess them in peace, but shall be scourged with a sore scourge; yet your children may possess them, but not until many years shall pass away; and as to the organization of that branch of the Church, it is not according to the Spirit and will of God; and as to the designs of the leading members of that branch relative to the printing press, and the ordaining of Elders, and sending out Elders to beg for the poor, are not according to the will of God; and in these things they shall not prosper, for they have neglected the House of the Lord, the baptismal font, in this place, wherein their dead may be redeemed, and the key of knowledge that unfolds the dispensation of the fullness of times may be turned, and the mysteries of God be unfolded, upon which their salvation, and the salvation of the world, and the redemption of their dead depends; for "thus saith the Lord," there shall not be a general assembly for a general conference assembled together until the House of the Lord and the baptismal font shall be finished; and if we are not diligent the Church shall be rejected, and their dead also, saith the Lord." Therefore, dear brethren, any proceedings of the Saints otherwise than to put forth their hands with their might to do this work, is not according to the will of God, and shall not prosper; therefore, tarry not in any place whatever, but come forth unto this place from all the world, until it is filled up, and polished, and sanctified according to my word, saith the Lord. Come ye forth from the ends of the earth, that I may hide you from mine indignation that shall scourge the wicked, and then I will send forth and build up Kirtland, and it shall be polished and refined according to my word; therefore your doings and your organizations and designs in printing, or any of your councils, are not of me, saith the Lord, even so. Amen.</p>

<p>Patriarch for the whole Church.</p>
<p><em>Monday, November 1.</em>--I attended the city council, spoke and acted on many local matters, and contended at great length against paying the owner of a city nuisance, damages sustained by the removal of that nuisance. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-1">1</a></p>
<p><a name="445" id="445"></a>[Page 445]</p>
<p>Sidney Rigdon resigned his seat in the city council, on account of ill health.</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 2.</em>--I executed letters today revoking the power of attorney given to Almon W. Babbitt.</p>
<p><em>Saturday, 6.</em>--Wilford Woodruff took the oath as a councilor in the city council.</p>
<p><em>Sunday, 7.</em>--Elder William O. Clark preached about two hours, reproving the Saints for a lack of sanctity, and a want of holy living, enjoining sanctity, solemnity, and temperance in the extreme, in the rigid sectarian style.</p>
<p><strong>Reproof of William O. Clark.</strong></p>
<p>I reproved him as Pharisaical and hypocritical and not edifying the people; and showed the Saints what temperance, faith, virtue, charity, and truth were. I charged the Saints not to follow the example of the adversary in accusing the brethren, and said, "If you do not accuse each other, God will not accuse you. If you have no accuser you will enter heaven, and if you will follow the revelations and instructions which God gives you through me, I will take you into heaven as my back load. If you will not accuse me, I will not accuse you. If you will throw a cloak of charity over my sins, I will over yours--for charity covereth a multitude of sins. What many people call sin is not sin; I do many things to break down superstition, and I will break it down;" I referred to the curse of Ham for laughing at Noah, while in his wine, but doing no harm. Noah was a righteous man, and yet he drank wine and became intoxicated; the Lord did not forsake him in consequence thereof, for he retained all the power of his priesthood, and when he was accused by Canaan, he cursed him by the priesthood which he held, and the Lord had respect to his word, and the priesthood which he held, notwithstanding he was drunk, and the curse remains upon the posterity of Canaan until the present day.</p>
<p><a name="446" id="446"></a>[Page 446]</p>
<p>In the p.m., I attended a council of the Elders at my council room, relative to some affairs in which my brother William was interested.</p>
<p><strong>Dedication of the Baptismal Font.</strong></p>
<p><em>Monday, 8.</em>--At five o'clock p.m., I attended the dedication of the baptismal font in the Lord's House. President Brigham Young was spokesman.</p>
<p>The baptismal font is situated in the center of the basement room, under the main hall of the Temple; it is constructed of pine timber, and put together of staves tongued and grooved, oval shaped, sixteen feet long east and west, and twelve feet wide, seven feet high from the foundation, the basin four feet deep, the moulding of the cap and base are formed of beautiful carved work in antique style. The sides are finished with panel work. A flight of stairs in the north and south sides lead up and down into the basin, guarded by side railing.</p>
<p>The font stands upon twelve oxen, four on each side, and two at each end, their heads, shoulders, and fore legs projecting out from under the font; they are carved out of pine plank, glued together, and copied after the most beautiful five-year-old steer that could be found in the country, and they are an excellent striking likeness of the original; the horns were formed after the most perfect horn that could be procured.</p>
<p>The oxen and ornamental mouldings of the font were carved by Elder Elijah Fordham, from the city of New York, which occupied eight months of time. The font was enclosed by a temporary frame building sided up with split oak clapboards, with a roof of the same material, and was so low that the timbers of the first story were laid above it. The water was supplied from a well thirty feet deep in the east end of the basement.</p>
<p>This font was built for the baptisms for the dead until the Temple shall be finished, when a more durable one will supply its place.</p>
<p><a name="447" id="447"></a>[Page 447]</p>
<p>I received a letter from N. K. Whitney, stating that he had purchased $5,000 worth of goods for me; and that he should visit Kirtland before his return home.</p>
<p>Up to this period a series of storms and earthquakes have desolated parts of the two Sicilies.</p>
<p>A second English edition of the Saints' hymn book has been issued by Elder Parley P. Pratt.</p>
<p>A great part of Vicksburg, Mississippi, has been consumed by fire.</p>
<p><em>Saturday, 13.</em>--I attended the city council, and moved that the mayor and recorder of the city receive each one hundred dollars per annum for their services, which became a law.</p>
<p>I also presented a bill for "An ordinance concerning vagrants and disorderly persons," which passed into an ordinance as follows--</p>
<p>An Ordinance Concerning Vagrants and Disorderly Persons.</p>
<p>Be it ordained by the city council of the city of Nauvoo, that all vagrants, idle, or disorderly persons; persons found drunk in or about the streets; all suspicious persons; persons who have no fixed place of residence, or visible means of support, or cannot give a good account of themselves; persons guilty of profane and indecent language or behavior; persons guilty of using indecent, impertinent, or unbecoming language towards any city officer when in the discharge of his duty, or of menacing, threatening or otherwise obstructing said officer, shall on conviction thereof before the mayor or municipal court, be required to enter into security for good behavior for a reasonable time, and indemnify the corporation against any charge, and in case of refusal or inability to give security, they shall be confined to labor for a time not exceeding ninety days, or be fined in any sum not exceeding five hundred dollars, or be imprisoned not exceeding six months or all, [i.e. or both imprisonment and fine] at the discretion of said mayor or court.</p>
<p>I also presented a bill for "An ordinance in relation to appeals," which passed unanimously.</p>
<p>I also argued before the council the right of taxation, but that the expense of the city did not require it at present.</p>
<p><a name="448" id="448"></a>[Page 448]</p>
<p><em>Sunday, 14.</em>--I preached to a large congregation at the Temple.</p>
<p>Nine of the Twelve Apostles met in council, to prepare an epistle to the Saints in Europe.</p>
<p><em>Monday, 15.</em></p>
<p>An Epistle of the Twelve Apostles to the Saints Scattered Abroad in England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, the Isle of Man, and the Eastern Continent, Greeting:</p>
<p>Beloved Brethren:--We rejoice and thank our Heavenly Father daily in your behalf, that we hear of your faithfulness and diligence in the great work unto which you have been called, by the Holy Spirit, through the voice of the servants of the Most High, who have been, and are now amongst you, for the purpose of instructing you in those principles which are calculated to prepare the children of men for the renovation of the earth, and the restitution of all things spoken by the Prophets.</p>
<p>Several months have passed away, since we bid adieu to our brethren and sisters on the islands of the sea, and passed over the great deep to our homes, our kindred, the bosom of the Church, and the stakes of Zion: but neither time nor distance can efface from our memories the many expressions of kindness which we have heard from your lips and experienced from your hands, which have so often ministered to our necessities, while we were wandering in your midst, like our Master, having no place to lay our heads, only as furnished by your liberality and benevolence; and it is a subject of no small consolation to us that we have this testimony of so many of you, that you are the disciples of the Lord Jesus; <a class="footnote" href="#fn-2">2</a> and we give you our warmest thanks, and our blessing, that you have not only ministered unto us, but that you continue to minister to our brethren who are still laboring amongst you, for which an hundred fold shall be returned unto your bosoms.</p>
<p>After parting with the Saints in Liverpool, and sailing thirty days, much of the time against head winds, with rough seas, which produced much sea sickness among the brethren and sisters who accompanied us, we arrived in the city of New York, where we were received by the brethren with open hearts, and by whom we were entertained most cordially some days, till we were rested from the fatigues of the ship: we were then assisted on our journey, and taking different routes, and visiting many of the churches in different states, we have all safely arrived in this city.</p>
<p><a name="449" id="449"></a>[Page 449]</p>
<p>In our travels in this land, we have discovered a growing interest among the people generally, in the great work of the Lord. Prejudice is giving way to intelligence; darkness to light; and multitudes are making the important discovery that error is abroad in the earth, and that the signs of the times proclaim some mighty revolution among the nations. The cry is from all quarters, send us Elders to instruct us in the principles of your religion, that we may know why it is that you are had in derision by the multitude, more than other professors are. Teach us of your principles and your doctrines, and if we find them true we will embrace them.</p>
<p>The Saints are growing in faith, and the intelligence of heaven is flowing into their understanding, for the Spirit of the Lord is with them, and the Holy Ghost is instructing them in things to come. The spirit of union is increasing, and they are exerting themselves to come up to the gathering of the faithful, to build up the waste places and establish the stakes of Zion.</p>
<p>Since our arrival in this place there has been one special and one general conference of the Church, and the Twelve have been called to tarry at home for a season, and stand in their lot next to the First Presidency, and assist in counseling the brethren, and in the settling of immigrants, &amp;c.; and the first great object before us, and the Saints generally, is to help forward the completion of the Temple and the Nauvoo House--buildings which are now in progress according to the revelations, and which must be completed to secure the salvation of the Church in the last days; for God requires of His Saints to build Him a house wherein his servants may be instructed, and endowed with power from on high, to prepare them to go forth among the nations, and proclaim the fullness of the Gospel for the last time, and bind up the law, and seal up the testimony, leaving this generation without excuse, and the earth prepared for the judgments which will follow. In this house all the ordinances will be made manifest, and many things will be shown forth, which have been hid from generation to generation.</p>
<p>The set time to favor the stakes of Zion is at hand, and soon the kings and the queens, the princes and the nobles, the rich and the honorable of the earth will come up hither to visit the Temple of our God, and to inquire concerning His strange work; and as kings are to become nursing fathers, and queens nursing mothers in the habitations of the righteous, it is right to render honor to whom honor is due; and therefore expedient that such, as well as the Saints, should have a comfortable house for boarding and lodging when they come hither, and it is according to the revelations that such a house should be built.</p>
<p><a name="450" id="450"></a>[Page 450]</p>
<p>The foundations of this house, and also of the Temple, are laid; and the walls of the basement stories of each nearly completed; and the finishing of the whole is depending on the exertions of the Saints. Every Saint on earth is equally interested in these things, and all are under equal obligations to do all in their power to complete the buildings by their faith, and by their prayers, with their thousands and their mites, their gold and their silver, their copper and their zinc, their goods and their labors, until the top stone is laid with shoutings, and the place is prepared to be filled with the glory of the Highest; and if there are those among you who have more than they need for the gathering, and for assisting the destitute who desire to gather with them, they cannot make a more acceptable offering unto the Lord, than by appropriating towards the building of His Temple.</p>
<p>He that believeth shall not make haste, but let all the Saints who desire to keep the commandments of heaven and work righteousness, come to the place of gathering as soon as circumstances will permit. It is by united efforts that great things are accomplished, and while the Saints are scattered to the four winds, they cannot be united in action, if they are in spirit; they cannot all build at one city, or lift at one stone of the great Temple, though their hearts may all desire the same thing. We would not press the subject of the gathering upon you, for we know your hearts, and your means; and so far as means fail, let patience have its perfect work in your souls, for in due time you shall be delivered, if you faint not.</p>
<p>We are not altogether ignorant of the increase of difficulty among the laboring classes in England since our departure through the stoppage of factories and similar occurrences, and we would counsel those who have, to impart unto those who have not, and cannot obtain; remembering that he who giveth unto the poor lendeth unto the Lord, and he shall receive in return four fold.</p>
<p>The idler shall not eat the bread of the laborer; neither must he starve who would [labor] but cannot find employment. Inasmuch as ye desire the fullness of the earth, let not the cries of the widow, the fatherless and the beggar ascend to heaven, or salute your ears in vain, but follow the example we have set before you, and give liberally of your abundance, even if it be but a penny, and it shall be returned unto you. Good measure pressed down and running over, shall the Lord return into your store house.</p>
<p>Cultivate the spirit of patience, long-suffering, forbearance and charity among yourselves, and ever be as unwilling to believe an evil report about a brother or a sister as if it were about yourself, and as you dislike to be accused, be slow to accuse the brethren, for the measure you mete shall be measured to you again, and the Judge condemneth no man who is not accused.</p>
<p><a name="451" id="451"></a>[Page 451]</p>
<p>Keep all the commandments, nothing fearing, nothing doubting, for this is virtue, this is wisdom, and the wise, the virtuous and the meek shall inherit the earth and the fullness thereof. In all things follow the counsel which you shall receive from the president and council who are among you; and inasmuch as you uphold Elders Pratt, Richards and Snow by the prayer of faith, you shall receive right counsel.</p>
<p>Remember that those whom John saw on Mount Zion were such as had come up through great tribulation; and do not imagine that you can ever constitute a part of that number without sharing a part of their trials. You must necessarily pass through perils and trials, and temptations and afflictions by sea and land in your journeyings hither, and if you cannot settle it in your hearts to endure unto the end as good soldiers, you may as well remain where you are to be destroyed, as to suffer all the privations and hardships you will be obliged to suffer before the walls of Zion shall be built, no more to be thrown down, and after all to turn away and be destroyed.</p>
<p>The ancient prophet has said, they shall wear out the Saints of the Most High. This has already been fulfilled to some extent, for many through the abundance of their persecutions have become exhausted, and laid their bodies down to rest, to rise no more till the morn of the first resurrection; and although the people of these states are at peace with us, yet there are those who would gladly wear out and destroy the weak in faith, through the influence of their foolish lies. When you arrive on our shores, and while sailing up our rivers, you need not be surprised if your ears are saluted by the false and filthy language of wicked and designing men who are ever ready to speak evil of the things they understand not, and who would gladly blast the character of the Prophet of the Most High God, and all connected with him, with their foul anathemas, beyond anything you ever thought of. We would not dishearten you, neither would we have you ignorant of the worst that awaits the righteous.</p>
<p>If the Saints are not prepared to rejoice and be glad when they hear the name of the Prophet and their own name cast out as evil, as gluttonous, wine-bibber, friend of publicans and sinners, Beelzebub, thief, robber and murderer, they are not prepared for the gathering.Â The wheat and tares must grow together till the harvest; at the harvest the wheat is gathered together into the threshing floor, so with the Saints--the stakes are the threshing floor. Here they will be threshed with all sorts of difficulties, trials, afflictions and everything to mar their peace, which they can imagine, and thousands which they cannot imagine, but he that endures the threshing till all the chaff, superstition, folly and unbelief are pounded out of him, and does not suffer himself to be blown away as chaff by the foul blast of slander, but endures faithfully to the end, shall be saved. If you are prepared for all these things; if you choose rather to suffer afflictions with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a little moment, come up hither; come direct to New Orleans, and up the Mississippi river, for the expense is so much less, and the convenience of water navigation is so much greater than it is by Montreal, New York or Philadelphia, that it is wisdom for the Saints to make New Orleans their general established port, and be sure to start at such times that they may arrive here during the cold months, for the change from the cold climate of England to this place in the hot season, is too great for the health of immigrants, till there is more faith in the Church.</p>
<p><a name="452" id="452"></a>[Page 452]</p>
<p>In this region of country there are thousands and millions of acres of beautiful prairie unoccupied, which can be procured on reasonable terms, and we will hail the time with joy when these unoccupied lands shall be turned into fruitful fields, and the hands of those who are now idle for want of employment shall be engaged in the cultivation of the soil.</p>
<p>When the brethren arrive they will do well to call on some of the Twelve, inasmuch as they desire counsel, for by so doing they may escape the influence of designing men who have crept in unawares, and would willingly subvert the truth by conniving to their own advantage, if they have the opportunity.</p>
<p>The Church has commenced a new city twenty miles below this, and one mile below Warsaw, called Warren, where many city lots and farms in the vicinity can be had on reasonable terms; and it will be wisdom for many of the brethren to stop at that place, for the opportunity for erecting temporary buildings will be greater than at this place, also the chance for providing food will be superior to those who wish to labor for it.</p>
<p>Warsaw is at the foot of the Des Moines Rapids, and one of the best locations for mercantile purposes there is in this western country.</p>
<p>So far as the brethren have the means they will do well to come prepared with a variety of mechanical tools according to their professions, such as carpenters, joiners, cabinet-makers, hatters, coopers, masons, printers, binders, tanners, curriers, &amp;c., and all sorts of manufactory and foundry implements convenient for transportation, so that when they arrive they may be prepared to establish themselves in business, and give employment to spinners, weavers, moulders, smelters and journeymen of every description; for all sorts of woollens, cottons, hardware, &amp;c., will find a ready market in new countries, and a great field is now open to the capitalists in this vicinity, even though the capital be small, and we would urge the importance of the immediate establishment of all kinds of manufactories among us, as well for the best interests of the individuals concerned, as for the Church generally.</p>
<p><a name="453" id="453"></a>[Page 453]</p>
<p>Cities cannot be built without houses, houses cannot be built without materials, or occupied without inhabitants, the inhabitants cannot exist without food and clothing; food and clothing cannot be had without planting, sowing, and manufacturing, so that Zion and her stores cannot be built without means, without industry, without manufacturing establishments unless the windows of heaven were opened, and cities and their appendages were rained down among us. But this we do not expect until the new Jerusalem descends, and that will be some time hence; therefore it is necessary and according to godliness and the plan of salvation in these last days, that the brethren should see to all these things, and clothe and adorn themselves with the labor of their own hands, build houses and inhabit them, plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof.</p>
<p>Brethren, pray for us and the First Presidency, the leader of the people, even Joseph, that his life and health may be precious in the sight of heaven, till he has finished the work which he has commenced: and for the Elders of Israel, that every man may be faithful in his calling, the whole household of faith, and all subjects of prayer.</p>
<p>Brethren, farewell; may the blessings of heaven and earth be multiplied unto you in spirit and in body, in basket and in store, in the field and in the shop, on the land and on the sea, in the house and by the way, and in all situations and circumstances, until you shall stand on Mount Zion, and enter the celestial city; in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

<p>Elder Orson Hyde's Letter--His Prayer of Dedication on the Mount of Olives.</p>
<p>Alexandria, Nov. 22, 1841.</p>
<p>Dear Brother Pratt:--A few minutes now offer for me to write, and I improve them in writing to you.</p>
<p><a name="455" id="455"></a>[Page 455]</p>
<p>I have only time to say that I have seen Jerusalem precisely according to the vision which I had. I saw no one with me in the vision; and although Elder Page was appointed to accompany me there, yet I found myself there alone.</p>
<p>The Lord knows that I have had a hard time, and suffered much, but I have great reason to thank Him that I enjoy good health at present, and have a prospect before me of soon going to a civilized country, where I shall see no more turbans or camels. The heat is most oppressive, and has been all through Syria.</p>
<p>I have not time to tell you how many days I have been at sea, without food, or how many snails I have eaten; but if I had had plenty of them, I should have done very well. All this is contained in a former letter to you written from Jaffa.</p>
<p>I have been at Cairo, on the Nile, because I could not get a passage direct. Syria is in a dreadful state--a war of extermination is going on between the Druses and Catholics. At the time I was at Beyroot, a battle was fought in the mountains of Lebanon, near that place, and about 800 killed. Robberies, thefts and murders are daily being committed. It is no uncommon thing to find persons in the streets without heads. An English officer, in going from St. Jean D'Acre to Beyroot, found ten persons murdered in the street, and was himself taken prisoner, but was rescued by the timely interference of the pasha. The particulars of all these things are contained in a former letter.</p>
<p>An American traveler, by the name of Gager, who was a licensed minister of the Congregational or Presbyterian church, left Jerusalem in company with me. He was very unwell with the jaundice when we left, and at Damietta, we had to perform six days quarantine before we ascended the Nile. On our passage up, he was taken very ill with a fever, and became helpless. I waited and tended upon him as well as our circumstances would allow; and when we landed at Bulack, I got four men to take him to the American consuls at Cairo, on a litter; I also took all his baggage there, and assisted in putting him upon a good bed--employed a good faithful Arabian nurse, and the English doctor. After the physician had examined him, he told me that he was very low with a typhus fever, and that it would be doubtful whether he recovered. Under these circumstances I left him to obtain a passage to this place. After I had gone on board a boat, and was just about pushing off, a letter came from the doctor, stating that poor Mr. Gager died in about two hours after I left him. He told me before we arrived at Cairo that he was twenty-seven years of age, and his friends lived in Norwich, Connecticut, near New London, I think. There are many particulars concerning his death, which would be interesting to his friends, but I have no time to write them now.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, October 24, a good while before day, I arose from sleep, and went out of the city as soon as the gates were opened, crossed the brook Kedron, and went upon the Mount of Olives, and there, in solemn silence, with pen, ink, and paper, just as I saw in the vision, offered up the following prayer to Him who lives forever and ever--</p>
<p>Prayer of Orson Hyde on the Mount of Olives.</p>
<p>"O Thou! who art from everlasting to everlasting, eternally and unchangeably the same, even the God who rules in the heavens above, and controls the destinies of men on the earth, wilt Thou not condescend, through thine infinite goodness and royal favor, to listen to the prayer of Thy servant which he this day offers up unto Thee in the name of Thy holy child Jesus, upon this land, where the Son of Righteousness set in blood, and thine Anointed One expired.</p>
<p>"Be pleased, O Lord, to forgive all the follies, weaknesses, vanities, and sins of Thy servant, and strengthen him to resist all future temptations. Give him prudence and discernment that he may avoid the evil, and a heart to choose the good; give him fortitude to bear up under trying and adverse circumstances, and grace to endure all things for Thy name's sake, until the end shall come, when all the Saints shall rest in peace.</p>
<p>Now, O Lord! Thy servant has been obedient to the heavenly vision which Thou gavest him in his native land; and under the shadow of Thine outstretched arm, he has safely arrived in this place to dedicate and consecrate this land unto Thee, for the gathering together of Judah's scattered remnants, according to the predictions of the holy Prophets--for the building up of Jerusalem again after it has been trodden down by the Gentiles so long, and for rearing a Temple in honor of Thy name. Everlasting thanks be ascribed unto Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that Thou hast preserved Thy servant from the dangers of the seas, and from the plague and pestilence which have caused the land to mourn. The violence of man has also been restrained, and Thy providential care by night and by day has been exercised over Thine unworthy servant. Accept, therefore, O Lord, the tribute of a grateful heart for all past favors, and be pleased to continue Thy kindness and mercy towards a needy worm of the dust.</p>
<p>"O Thou, Who didst covenant with Abraham, Thy friend, and who didst renew that covenant with Isaac, and confirm the same with Jacob with an oath, that Thou wouldst not only give them this land for an everlasting inheritance, but that Thou wouldst also remember their seed forever. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob have long since closed their eyes in death, and made the grave their mansion. Their children are scattered and dispersed abroad among the nations of the Gentiles like sheep that have no shepherd, and are still looking forward for the fulfillment of those promises which Thou didst make concerning them; and even this land, which once poured forth nature's richest bounty, and flowed, as it were, with milk and honey, has, to a certain extent, been smitten with barrenness and sterility since it drank from murderous hands the blood of Him who never sinned.</p>
<p><a name="457" id="457"></a>[Page 457]</p>
<p>"Grant, therefore, O Lord, in the name of Thy well-beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to remove the barrenness and sterility of this land, and let springs of living water break forth to water its thirsty soil. Let the vine and olive produce in their strength, and the fig-tree bloom and flourish. Let the land become abundantly fruitful when possessed by its rightful heirs; let it again flow with plenty to feed the returning prodigals who come home with a spirit of grace and supplication; upon it let the clouds distil virtue and richness, and let the fields smile with plenty. Let the flocks and the herds greatly increase and multiply upon the mountains and the hills; and let Thy great kindness conquer and subdue the unbelief of Thy people. Do Thou take from them their stony heart, and give them a heart of flesh; and may the Sun of Thy favor dispel the cold mists of darkness which have beclouded their atmosphere. Incline them to gather in upon this land according to Thy word. Let them come like clouds and like doves to their windows. Let the large ships of the nations bring them from the distant isles; and let kings become their nursing fathers, and queens with motherly fondness wipe the tear of sorrow from their eye.</p>
<p>"Thou, O Lord, did once move upon the heart of Cyrus to show favor unto Jerusalem and her children. Do Thou now also be pleased to inspire the hearts of kings and the powers of the earth to look with a friendly eye towards this place, and with a desire to see Thy righteous purposes executed in relation thereto. Let them know that it is Thy good pleasure to restore the kingdom unto Israel--raise up Jerusalem as its capital, and constitute her people a distinct nation and government, with David Thy servant, even a descendant from the loins of ancient David to be their king.</p>
<p>"Let that nation or that people who shall take an active part in behalf of Abraham's children, and in the raising up of Jerusalem, find favor in Thy sight. Let not their enemies prevail against them, neither let pestilence or famine overcome them, but let the glory of Israel overshadow them, and the power of the Highest protect them; while that nation or kingdom that will not serve Thee in this glorious work must perish, according to Thy word--Yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted."</p>
<p><a name="458" id="458"></a>[Page 458]</p>
<p>"Though Thy servant is now far from his home, and from the land bedewed with his earliest tear, yet he remembers, O Lord, his friends who are there, and family, whom for Thy sake he has left. Though poverty and privation be our earthly lot, yet ah! do Thou richly endow us with an inheritance where moth and rust do not corrupt, and where thieves do not break through and steal.</p>
<p>"The hands that have fed, clothed, or shown favor unto the family of Thy servant in his absence, or that shall hereafter do so, let them not lose their reward, but let a special blessing rest upon them, and in Thy kingdom let them have an inheritance when Thou shalt come to be glorified in this society.</p>
<p>"Do Thou also look with favor upon all those through whose liberality I have been enabled to come to this land; and in the day when Thou shalt reward all people according to their works, let these also not be passed by or forgotten, but in time let them be in readiness to enjoy the glory of those mansions which Jesus has gone to prepare. Particularly do Thou bless the stranger in Philadelphia, whom I never saw, but who sent me gold, with a request that I should pray for him in Jerusalem. Now, O Lord, let blessings come upon him from an unexpected quarter, and let his basket be filled, and his storehouse abound with plenty, and let not the good things of the earth be his only portion, but let him be found among those to whom it shall be said, 'Thou hast been faithful over a few things, and I will make thee ruler over many.'</p>
<p>"O my Father in heaven! I now ask Thee in the name of Jesus to remember Zion, with all her Stakes, and with all her assemblies. She has been grievously afflicted and smitten; she has mourned; she has wept; her enemies have triumphed, and have said, 'Ah, where is thy God?' Her Priests and Prophets have groaned in chains and fetters within the gloomy walls of prisons, while many were slain, and now sleep in the arms of death. How long, O Lord, shall iniquity triumph, and sin go unpunished?</p>
<p>"Do Thou arise in the majesty of Thy strength, and make bare Thine arm in behalf of Thy people. Redress their wrongs, and turn their sorrow into joy. Pour the spirit of light and knowledge, grace and wisdom, into the hearts of her Prophets, and clothe her Priests with salvation. Let light and knowledge march forth through the empire of darkness, and may the honest in heart flow to their standard, and join in the march to go forth to meet the Bridegroom.</p>
<p>Let a peculiar blessing rest upon the Presidency of Thy Church, for at them are the arrows of the enemy directed. Be Thou to them a sun and a shield, their strong tower and hiding place; and in the time of distress or danger be Thou near to deliver. Also the quorum of the Twelve, do Thou be pleased to stand by them for Thou knowest the obstacles which they have to encounter, the temptations to which they are exposed, and the privations which they must suffer. Give us, [the Twelve] therefore, strength according to our day, and help us to bear a faithful testimony of Jesus and His Gospel, to finish with fidelity and honor the work which Thou hast given us to do, and then give us a place in Thy glorious kingdom. And let this blessing rest upon every faithful officer and member in Thy Church. And all the glory and honor will we ascribe unto God and the Lamb forever and ever. Amen."</p>

<p>On the top of Mount Olives I erected a pile of stones as a witness according to ancient custom. On what was anciently called Mount Zion, [Moriah?] where the Temple stood, I erected another, and used the rod according to the prediction upon my head.</p>
<p>I have found many Jews who listened with intense interest. The idea of the Jews being restored to Palestine is gaining ground in Europe almost every day. Jerusalem is strongly fortified with many cannon upon its walls. The wall is ten feet thick on the sides that would be most exposed, and four or five feet where the descent from the wall is almost perpendicular. The number of inhabitants within the walls is about twenty thousand. About seven thousand of this number are Jews, the balance being mostly Turks and Armenians. Many of the Jews who are old go to this place to die, and many are coming from Europe into this eastern world. The great wheel is unquestionably in motion, and the word of the Almighty has declared that it shall roll.</p>
<p>I have not time to write particulars now, but suffice it to say that my mission has been quite as prosperous as I could expect.</p>
<p>I am now about to go on board a fine ship for Trieste, and from thence I intend to proceed to Regensburg and there publish our faith in the German language. There are those who are ready and willing to assist me.</p>
<p>I send you this letter by Captain Withers, an English gentleman, who goes direct to England, on board the Oriental steamer. He has come with me from Jerusalem. If I had money sufficient I should be almost tempted to take passage on board of her to England, but this I cannot do.</p>
<p>On receipt of this, I wish you to write to me immediately, and direct to Regensburg, on the Danube, Bayern, or Bavaria. If you know anything of my family tell me.</p>
<p>My best respects to yourself and your family, to Brothers Adams and Snow, and to all the Saints in England.</p>
<p>May grace, mercy and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, rest upon you all from this time, henceforth and for ever. Amen.</p>
<p>Your brother in Christ,</p>
<p>Orson Hyde.</p>
