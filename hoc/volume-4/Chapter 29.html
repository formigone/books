<p>Chapter 29</p>
<p>The Opening of the Year 1842--Whereabouts of the Twelve Apostles--Correspondence of Elder Hyde from Trieste--Report of High Council on Affairs in Nauvoo--Events and Conditions in British Mission.</p>
<p><strong>Sundry Labors of the Prophet.</strong></p>
<p><em>Saturday, January 1, 1842.</em>--I again have the pleasure to report the location of the Twelve Apostles. Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Orson Pratt, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff and Willard Richards are in Nauvoo. George A. Smith, in Zarahemla, Ohio. Orson Hyde in quarantine at Trieste, Italy. Parley P. Pratt in Liverpool. Lyman Wight in Ohio. William Smith in New Jersey. John E. Page somewhere in the Eastern States.</p>
<p>I commenced placing goods on the shelves of my new store, assisted by Bishop Newel K. Whitney and others; and in the evening attended city council.</p>
<p>Five hundred and twelve Saints were reported at the Glasgow Conference of this date.</p>
<p>Several of the Twelve spent the day at Sylvester B. Stoddard's and in the city council, which lasted from 6 p.m. until midnight, on the trial of Gustavus Hills.</p>
<p><em>Sunday, 2.</em>--Meeting at my house, day and evening; Brother Hyrum and Elder Woodruff preached.</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 4</em>--I wrote Dr. John M. Bernhisel, of New York, on business.</p>
<p>Joseph Duncan, candidate for Governor of Illinois, made an inflammatory speech against the Saints at Edwardsville, a mass of falsehoods.</p>
<p><a name="491" id="491"></a>[Page 491]</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 5.</em>--William Wightman signed over and delivered the town plat of Ramus to me, as sole Trustee in Trust for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>My new store was opened for business this day for the first time, it was filled with customers, and I was almost continually behind the counter, as clerk, waiting on my friends.</p>
<p>I dictated a letter to Edward Hunter, West Nantmeal, Pennsylvania, as follows:</p>
<p>The Prophet's Letter to Edward Hunter--Reports Opening of the New Store.</p>
<p>Nauvoo, January 5, 1842.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Edward Hunter.</em></p>
<p>Beloved Brother:--I am happy that it is my privilege to say to you that the large new building which I had commenced when you were here is now completed, and the doors are opened this day for the sale of goods for the first time. The foundation of the building is somewhat spacious (as you will doubtless recollect) for a country store.</p>
<p>The principal part of the building below, which is ten feet high, is devoted exclusively to shelves and drawers, except one door opening back into the space, on the left of which are the cellar and chamber stairs, and on the right the counting room; from the space at the top of the chamber stairs opens a door into the large front room of the same size with the one below, the walls lined with counters, covered with reserved goods.</p>
<p>In front of the stairs opens the door to my private office, or where I keep the sacred writings, with a window to the south, overlooking the river below, and the opposite shore for a great distance, which, together with the passage of boats in the season thereof, constitutes a peculiarly interesting situation, in prospect, and no less interesting from its retirement from the bustle and confusion of the neighborhood and city, and altogether is a place the Lord is pleased to bless.</p>
<p>The painting of the store has been executed by Edward Martin, one of our English brethren; and the counters, drawers, and pillars present a very respectable representation of oak, mahogany and marble for a backwoods establishment.</p>
<p>The Lord has blessed our exertions in a wonderful manner, and although some individuals have succeeded in detaining goods to a considerable amount for the time being, yet we have been enabled to secure goods in the building sufficient to fill all the shelves as soon as they were completed, and have some in reserve, both in loft and cellar.</p>
<p><a name="492" id="492"></a>[Page 492]</p>
<p>Our assortment is tolerably good--very good, considering the different purchases made by different individuals at different times, and under circumstances which controlled their choice to some extent; but I rejoice that we have been enabled to do as well as we have, for the hearts of many of the poor brethren and sisters will be made glad with those comforts which are now within their reach.</p>
<p>The store has been filled to overflowing, and I have stood behind the counter all day, dealing out goods as steady as any clerk you ever saw, to oblige those who were compelled to go without their usual Christmas and New Year's dinners, for the want of a little sugar, molasses, raisins, &amp;c., &amp;c; and to please myself also, for I love to wait upon the Saints, and be a servant to all, hoping that I may be exalted in the due time of the Lord.</p>
<p>With sentiments of high consideration, I remain your brother in Christ.</p>
<p>Joseph Smith.</p>
<p><strong>Rejoicing of the Prophet.</strong></p>
<p><em>Thursday, 6.</em>--The new year has been ushered in and continued thus far under the most favorable auspices, and the Saints seem to been influenced by a kind and indulgent Providence in their dispositions and [blessed with] means to rear the Temple of the Most High God, anxiously looking forth to the completion thereof as an event of the greatest importance to the Church and the world, making the Saints in Zion to rejoice, and the hypocrite and sinner to tremble. Truly this is a day long to be remembered by the Saints of the last days,--a day in which the God of heaven has begun to restore the ancient order of His kingdom unto His servants and His people,--a day in which all things are concurring to bring about the completion of the fullness of the Gospel, a fullness of the dispensation of dispensations, even the fullness of times; a day in which God has begun to make manifest and set in order in His Church those things which have been, and those things which the ancient prophets and wise men desired to see but died without beholding them; a day in which those things begin to be made manifest, which have been hid from before the foundation of the world, and which Jehovah has promised should be made known in His own due time unto His servants, to prepare the earth for the return of His glory, even a celestial glory, and a kingdom of Priests and kings to God and the Lamb, forever, on Mount Zion, and with him the hundred and forty and four thousand whom John the Revelator saw, all of which is to come to pass in the restitution of all things.</p>
<p><a name="493" id="493"></a>[Page 493]</p>
<p>Conference held at Zarahemla, at which that stake was discontinued; a branch was organized in place thereof, and John Smith appointed president.</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 12.</em>--The ship <em>Tremont</em> sailed from Liverpool for New Orleans with the Saints, about this time.</p>
<p>The following notice was published in the <em>Times and Seasons:</em></p>
<p>Tithings and Consecrations for the Temple of the Lord.</p>
<p>From this time the Recorder's Office will be opened on the Saturday of each week for the reception of the tithings and consecrations of the brethren, and closed on every other day of the week. This regulation is necessary, to give the Trustee and Recorder time to arrange the Book of Mormon, translation of the Bible, Hymn Book, and Doctrine and Covenants for the press, all of which the brethren are anxious to see in their most perfect form, consequently the Saints should be particular to bring their offerings on the day specified, until further notice, but not relax their exertions to carry on the work.</p>
<p>The Elders will please give the above notice in all public meetings until the plan is understood.</p>
<p>Willard Richards,</p>
<p>Recorder for the Temple.</p>
<p>Nauvoo, January 12, 1842.</p>
<p>I rode south about seven miles to my wood land, accompanied by Brother John Sanders and Peter Maughan, <a class="footnote" href="#fn-1">1</a> and found a vein of coal about eighteen inches thick, apparently of good quality for the western country.</p>
<p><a name="494" id="494"></a>[Page 494]</p>
<p>Elder Benjamin Winchester was suspended by the quorum of the Twelve until he made satisfaction for disobedience to the First Presidency.</p>
<p><em>Thursday, 13.</em>--My clerk, Willard Richards, commenced boarding with me.</p>
<p>The British forces having evacuated Cabul, <a class="footnote" href="#fn-2">2</a> they were attacked in the Pass, a few miles from the city, and after three days' fighting; they were nearly all slaughtered.</p>
<p><strong>Book of Mormon Corrections.</strong></p>
<p><em>Saturday, 15.</em>--I commenced reading the Book of Mormon at page 54, American stereotype edition (the previous pages having been corrected), purpose of correcting the stereotype plates of some errors which escaped notice in the first edition.</p>
<p>Attended city council, and was appointed on committee of ways and means and municipal laws.</p>
<p><em>Sunday, 16.</em>--I preached at my house, morning and evening, illustrating the nature of sin, and showing that it is not right to sin that grace may abound.</p>
<p><em>Monday, 17.</em>--Transacted a variety of business in the city. Myself and Brother Willard Richards dined with Sister Agnes M. Smith. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-3">3</a></p>
<p>In the evening I attended a council of the Twelve at my office; present, Elders Young, Kimball, Orson Pratt, Taylor, Woodruff, George A. Smith and Richards--appointed Elder Amos B. Fuller a mission to Chicago, according to the revelation of the 22nd of December, and Elder Henry Jacobs to accompany him. The council were unanimously opposed to Robinson's son's publishing the Book of Mormon and other books.</p>
<p><a name="495" id="495"></a>[Page 495]</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 18.</em>--This day revoked my power of attorney given to Dr. Isaac Galland to transact business for the Church.</p>
<p>After transacting a variety of business, sleeping an hour from bodily infirmities, I read for correction in the Book of Mormon, and debated in the evening with the mayor [John C. Bennett] concerning the Lamanites and Negroes.</p>
<p>For an extract of a letter from Elder Orson Hyde, "Trieste, January 1 and 18, 1842," see <em>Millennial Star,</em> vol. 2, pages 166-169. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-4">4</a></p>
<p>Highly Interesting from Jerusalem.</p>
<p>We have lately received two lengthy and highly interesting communications from Elder Orson Hyde, dated at Trieste, January 1st, and 18th, containing a sketch of his voyages and travels in the East, his visit to Jerusalem, a description of ancient Zion, the pool of Siloam, and many other places famous in holy writ, with several illustrations of the manners and customs of the East, as applicable to Scripture texts, and several conversations held between himself and some of the Jews, missionaries, etc., in Jerusalem, together with a masterly description of a terrible tempest and thunder storm at sea, with a variety of miscellaneous reflections and remarks, all written in an easy, elegant, and masterly style, partaking of the eloquent and sublime, and breathing a tone of that deep feeling, tenderness, and affection so characteristic of his mission and the spirit of his holy and sacred office.</p>
<p>Elder Hyde has by the grace of God been the first proclaimer of the fullness of the Gospel both on the continent of Europe and in far off Asia, among the nations of the East. In Germany, Turkey (Constantinople), Egypt, and Jerusalem. He has reared as it were the ensign of the latter-day glory, and sounded the trump of truth, calling upon the people of those regions to awake from their thousand years' slumber, and to make ready for their returning Lord.</p>
<p><a name="496" id="496"></a>[Page 496]</p>
<p>In his travels he has suffered much, and has been exposed to toils and dangers, to hunger, pestilence and war. He has been in perils by land and sea, in perils among robbers, in perils among heathens, Turks, Arabs, and Egyptians; but out of all these things the Lord hath delivered him, and hath restored him in safety to the shores of Europe, where he is tarrying for a little season, for the purpose of publishing the Truth in the German language, having already published it in French and English in the various countries of the East, and we humbly trust that his labors will be a lasting blessing to Jew and Gentile.</p>
<p>We publish the following extract of his communication, and we shall soon issue the whole from the press in pamphlet form. It will, no doubt, meet with a ready sale; and we purpose devoting the profits to his benefit, to assist him in his mission.</p>
<p>Excerpts from Elder Hyde's Letters.</p>
<p>"Summoning up, therefore, what little address I had, I procured a <em>valet d'place,</em> or lackey, and proceeded to the house of Mr. Simons, a very respectable Jew, who with some of his family had lately been converted and joined the English Church. I entered their dwelling. They had just sat down to enjoy a dish of coffee, but immediately arose from the table to meet me. I spoke to them in German and asked them if they spoke English. They immediately replied 'Yes,' which was a very agreeable sound to my ear. They asked me in German if I spoke English; I replied, 'Ya, mein Herr.' I then introduced myself to them, and with a little apology it passed off as well as though I had been introduced by the pasha. With that glow of warmth and familiarity which is a peculiar trait in the German character, they would have me sit down and take a dish with them; and as I began to relate some things relative to my mission, the smiles of joy which sat upon their countenances bespoke hearts not altogether indifferent. There were two ministers of the Church of England there. One was confined to his bed by sickness, and the other, a German, and a Jew by birth, soon came in. After an introduction, I took the liberty to lay open to him some of our principles, and gave him a copy of the communication to the Jews in Constantinople to read. After he had it, he said that my motives were undoubtedly very good, but questioned the propriety of my undertaking from the fact that I claimed God had sent me. If, indeed, I had gone to Jerusalem under the direction of some missionary board or society, and left God out of the question altogether, I should have been received as a celestial messenger. How truly did our Savior speak, when He said, 'I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not; but if another were to come in his own name, him ye would receive.' I replied, however, that so far as I could know my own heart, my motives were most certainly good; yet, said I, no better than the cause which has brought me here. But he, like all others who worship a God 'without body or parts,' said that miracles, visions, and prophecy had ceased.</p>
<p><a name="497" id="497"></a>[Page 497]</p>
<p>"The course which the popular clergy pursue at this time in relation to the Divine economy looks to me as though they would say, 'O Lord, we will worship Thee with all our hearts, serve Thee with all our souls, and be very pious and holy; we will even gather Israel, convert the heathen, and bring in the millennium, if Thou wilt only let us alone that we may do it in our own way, and according to our own will; but if Thou speakest from heaven to interfere with our plan, or cause any to see visions or dreams, or prophesy, whereby we are disturbed or interrupted in our worship, we will exert all our strength and skill to deny what Thou sayest, and charge it home upon the devil or some wild, fanatic spirit, as being its author.'</p>
<p>"That which was looked upon by the ancient saints as among the greatest favors and blessings, viz., revelation from God and communion with Him by dreams and by visions, is now looked upon by the religious world as the height of presumption and folly. The ancient saints considered their condition most deplorable when Jehovah would not speak to them; but the most orthodox religionists of this age deem it quite heterodox to even admit the probability that He ever will speak again. O my soul! language fails to paint the absurdity and abomination of such heaven-opposing and truth-excluding dogmas; and were it possible for those bright seraphs that surround the throne above, and bask in the sunbeams of immortality, to weep over the inconsistency and irrationality of mortals, the earth must be bedewed with celestial tears. My humble advice to all such is, that they repent and cast far from them these wicked traditions, and be baptized into the new and everlasting covenant, lest the Lord speak to them in His wrath, and vex them in His sore displeasure.</p>
<p>"After some considerable conversation upon the priesthood and the renewal of the covenant, I called upon him [i.e. the aforesaid German-Jew church of England minister] to be baptized for the remission of his sins, that he might receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. 'What' said he, 'I be baptized?' 'Yes,' said I, 'you be baptized.' 'Why,' saith he, 'I have been baptized already.' I replied something after the following: You have probably been sprinkled, but that has no more to do with baptism than any other ordinance of man's device; and even if you had been immersed, you would not have bettered your condition, for your priesthood is without power. If, indeed, the Catholic church has power to give you an ordination, and by that ordination confer the priesthood upon you, they certainly had power to nullify that act, and take the priesthood from you; and this power they exercised when you dissented from their communion, by excluding you from their church. But, if the Catholic church possessed not the priesthood, of course your claims to it are as groundless as the airy phantoms of heathen mythology. So, view the question on which side you may, there is no possible chance of admitting the validity of your claims to it. Be it known, therefore, that ordinances performed under the administration of such a priesthood, though they may even be correct in form, will be found destitute of the seal of that authority by which heaven will recognize His [own] in the day when every man's work shall be tried. Though a priesthood may be clothed with the wealth and honors of a great and powerful nation and command the respect and veneration of multitudes whose eyes are blinded by the thick veil of popular opinion, and whose powers of reflection and deep thought are confused and lost in the general cry of 'Great is Diana of the Ephesians,' yet all this does not impart to it the Divine sanction, or animate it with the spirit of life and power from the bosom of the living God; and there is a period in future time when, in the smoking ruins of Babel's pride and glory, it must fall and retire to the shades of forgetfulness, to the grief and mortification of its unfortunate votaries.'</p>
<p><a name="498" id="498"></a>[Page 498]</p>
<p>"In consequence of his great volubility, I was under the disagreeable necessity of tuning my voice to a pretty high key, and of spacing short between words, determining that neither his greatness or learning should shield him from the shafts of a faithful testimony. But there is more hope of those Jews receiving the fullness of the gospel, whose minds have never been poisoned by the bane of modern sectarianism, which closes the mouth of Deity and shuts up in heaven all the angels, visions, and prophesyings. Mrs. Whiting told me that there had been four Jewish people in Jerusalem converted and baptized by the English minister, and four only; and that a part of the ground for an English church had been purchased there. It was by political power and influence that the Jewish nation was broken down, and her subjects dispersed abroad; and I will here hazard the opinion, that by political power and influence they will be gathered and built up; and further, that England is destined in the wisdom and economy of heaven to stretch forth the arm of political power, and advance in the front ranks of this glorious enterprise. The Lord once raised up a Cyrus to restore the Jews, but that was not evidence that He owned the religion of the Persians. This opinion I submit, however, to your superior wisdom to correct if you shall find it wrong.</p>
<p>"There is an increasing anxiety in Europe for the restoration of that people [the Jews]; and this anxiety is not confined to the pale of any religious community, but it has found its way to the courts of kings. Special ambassadors have been sent, and consuls and consular agents have been appointed. The rigorous policy which has hitherto characterized the course of other nations towards them now begins to be softened by the oil of friendship, and modified by the balm of humanity. The sufferings and privations under which they have groaned for so many centuries have at length touched the main-springs of Gentile power and sympathy; and may the God of their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, fan the flame by celestial breezes, until Israel's banner, sanctified by a Savior's blood, shall float on the walls of old Jerusalem, and the mountains and valleys of Judea reverberate with their songs of praise and thanksgiving to the Lamb that was slain.</p>
<p><a name="499" id="499"></a>[Page 499]</p>
<p>"The imperial consul of Austria, at Galatz, near the mouth of the Danube, to whom I had a letter of introduction from his cousin in Vienna, told me that in consequence of so many of their Jewish subjects being inclined, of late, to remove to Syria and Palestine, his government had established a general consul at Beyroot for their protection. There are many Jews who care nothing about Jerusalem, and have no regard for God. Their money is the god they worship, yet there are many of the most pious and devout among them who look towards Jerusalem as the tender and affectionate mother looks upon the home where she left her lovely little babe."</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 19.</em>--I wrote Dr. Galland as follows:</p>
<p>The Prophet's Letter to Isaac Galland--On Settlement of Accounts.</p>
<p>Dear Sir:--By your reply of the 18th instant to my note of the 17th, I am led to conclude that you received my communication in a manner altogether unintended by me, and that there may be no misunderstanding between us, and that you may be satisfied that I did not intend, and that I do not now intend anything, only upon the principles of the strictest integrity and uprightness before God, and to do as I would be done unto, I will state I have become embarrassed in my operations to a certain extent, and partly from a presentation of notes, which you, as my agent, had given for lands purchased in the eastern states, they having been sent to me. I have been obliged to cash them, and having no returns from you to meet those demands, or even the trifling expenses of your outfit, it has placed me in rather an unpleasant situation, and having a considerable amount of your scrip on hand, enough, as I suppose, to counterbalance the debts due you, and leave a balance in my favor, to some extent, even if it were small; and as I was pressed for funds, from the causes above mentioned, as well as others, I had hoped it would be convenient for you to lend me some assistance at the present time, and this was the reason why I sent a messenger to you as I did.</p>
<p><a name="500" id="500"></a>[Page 500]</p>
<p>And now, sir, that we may have no misunderstanding in this matter, I think we had better have a settlement, and if I am owing you, I will pay you as soon as I can, and if you owe me, I shall only expect the same in return, for it is an old and trite maxim, that short reckonings make long friends. With this view of the matter, I would request you to call as soon as you possibly can make it convenient, and compare accounts, so that all things may be understood most perfectly between us in future time, and that all occasion for unpleasant feelings, if any such there be, may be entirely obliterated.</p>
<p>I remain, sir, most respectfully yours, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>Joseph Smith.</p>
<p>Read in the Book of Mormon, and in the evening visited Bishop Miller's wife, who was very sick, and the Bishop absent, collecting the funds for building the Temple and Nauvoo House.</p>
<p><strong>Isaac Galland Affair.</strong></p>
<p><em>Thursday, 20.</em>--I attended a special conference of the Church at 10 o'clock a.m., concerning Dr. Galland. The conference voted to sanction the revocation of Dr. Galland's agency, dated the 18th of January, as published in the <em>Times and Seasons,</em> and also instructed the trustee-in-trust to proceed with Dr. Galland's affairs in relation to the Church, as he shall judge most expedient.</p>
<p>Six o'clock evening, attended a special council in the upper room of the new store.</p>
<p>George Washington Gee died today. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-5">5</a></p>
<p><a name="501" id="501"></a>[Page 501]</p>
<p><em>Friday, 21.</em>--I read the Book of Mormon, transacted a variety of business in the store and city, and spent the evening in the office with Elders Taylor and Richards, interpreting dreams, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The presidents of the different quorums met with the High Council at Brother Hyrum's office, to receive instructions, according to appointment of the council on the 18th.</p>
<p><strong>Seventies' Quorum Affairs.</strong></p>
<p>President Joseph Young stated the reasons why the quorum of Seventies had granted licenses; that he applied to President Joseph Smith for permission, on the solicitations of the quorums; that their reasons for so doing were because licenses could not be obtained from the Church clerk. President Joseph Butterfield testified to the same, and the council was satisfied with the testimony. The council was then addressed by President Hyrum Smith on the Word of Wisdom.</p>
<p><em>Saturday, 22.</em>--I was very busy in appraising tithing property, and in the evening revised the rules of the city council, attended council, and spoke on their adoption, and was elected mayor, <em>pro tem.</em> of the city of Nauvoo.</p>
<p><em>Sunday, 23.</em>--Spent the day mostly at the office, and on the presentation of charges by Elder William Draper, Jun., silenced Elder Daniel Wood, of Pleasant Vale, for preaching that the Church ought to unsheath the sword, and Elder A. Litz for preaching that the authorities of the Church were done away, &amp;c., and cited him to appear before the High Council of Nauvoo for trial.</p>
<p><em>Monday, 24.</em>--Reckoned with William and Wilson Law in the counting room, and examined the lots on which they are about to build a steam, grain, and sawmill.</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 25.</em>--Signed deeds for lots, to Law; transacted a variety of business in the city and office. In the evening debated with John C. Bennett and others to show that the Indians have greater cause to complain of the treatment of the whites, than the negroes, or sons of Cain.</p>

<p>General Orders. All the public arms will be required to be in the best possible condition, at the general inspection and parade, on the 7th of May proximo, and no deficiency whatever will be countenanced, overlooked, or suffered to pass without fine, on that occasion. All persons, therefore, holding said arms, will take notice, and govern themselves accordingly; and in order that the general inspection may pass off in a truly military style, alike honorable to the Legion, and creditable to the citizen soldiers, the brigadiers are required to attend the battalion parades within their respective commands, and inspect said arms in <em>propria personae,</em> prior to the general parade. Persons disregarding these general orders, whether officers or privates, will find themselves in the <em>vocative</em>.

<p>Joseph Smith, Lieutenant General.</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 26.</em>--Rode out to borrow money, to refund for money borrowed of John Benbow, as outfit for Dr. Galland in his agency. Transacted a variety of business, explained scripture to Elder Orson Spencer in my office, read in the Book of Mormon in the evening. Wrote a long letter to Edward Hunter, West Nantmeal, on temporal business.</p>
<p>The Church is in a prosperous condition, and the Saints are exerting themselves to build the Temple. The health of the city is good.</p>
<p>Upwards of twenty-three vessels wrecked on different parts of the British coast.</p>
<p><em>Thursday, 27.</em>--Attended to baptism in general; in the afternoon, in council with the recorder, and gave some particular instructions concerning the order of the kingdom, and the management of business; placed the carpet given by Carlos Granger on the floor of my office; and spent the evening in general council in the upper room.</p>
<p><a name="503" id="503"></a>[Page 503]</p>
<p>In the course of the day, Brigham Young, and James Ivins returned, and gave a favorable report from Dr. Galland, with his letter of attorney, letters and papers which he had received of me and the Church.</p>
<p><em>Friday, 28.</em>--While I was at my office, Emma and Sister Whitney came in and spent an hour.</p>
<p>I received the following revelation to the Twelve concerning theÂ <em>Times and Seasons,</em>Â given January 28, 1842--</p>
<p>Revelation.</p>
<p>Verily thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant Joseph, go and say unto the Twelve, that it is my will to have them take in hand the editorial department of theÂ <em>Times and Seasons,</em>Â according to that manifestation which shall be given unto them by the power of my Holy Spirit in the midst of their counsel, saith the Lord. Amen.</p>
<p>I also decided that Elder John Snyder should go out on a mission, and if necessary some one go with him and raise up a church, and get means to go to England, and carry the epistle required in the revelation of December 22nd; and instructed the Twelve, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Wilford Woodruff and Willard Richards being present, to call Elder Snyder into their council and instruct him in these things, and if he will not do these things he shall be cut off from the Church, and be damned.</p>
<p>Elias Higbee, of the temple committee, came into my office, and I said unto him; The Lord is not well pleased with you; and you must straighten up your loins and do better, and your family also; for you have not been as diligent as you ought to have been, and as spring is approaching, you must arise and shake yourself, and be active, and make your children industrious, and help build the Temple.</p>
<p><a name="504" id="504"></a>[Page 504]</p>
<p>Elder Snyder had appeared very backward about fulfilling the revelation concerning him, and felt that he could not do it unless the Twelve would furnish him means, when he was more able to furnish his own means, as all the Elders were obliged to do when they went on missions, or go without.</p>
<p>The High Council heard and accepted the report of their committee of the 18th instant, as follows--</p>
<p>Report of High Council Committee.</p>
<p>The High Council of the Church of Jesus Christ to the Saints of Nauvoo, greeting--</p>
<p>Dear Brethren:--As watchmen upon the walls of Zion, we feel it to be our duty to stir up your minds, by way of remembrance, of things which we conceive to be of the utmost importance to the Saints.</p>
<p>While we rejoice at the health and prosperity of the Saints, and the good feeling which seems to prevail among them generally, and their willingness to aid in the building of the "House of the Lord," we are grieved at the conduct of some, who seem to have forgotten the purpose for which they have gathered.</p>
<p>Instead of promoting union, they have appeared to be engaged in sowing strifes and animosities among their brethren, spreading evil reports, brother going to law with brother for trivial causes, which we consider a great evil, and altogether unjustifiable, except in extreme cases, and then not before the world.</p>
<p>We feel to advise taking the word of God for our guide, and exhort you not to forget that you have come up as saviors upon Mount Zion, consequently to seek each other's good--to become one, inasmuch as the Lord has said, "Except ye become one, ye are not mine."</p>
<p>Let us always remember the admonition of the Apostle--"Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the Saints? Do ye not know the Saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life? If, then, ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the Church. I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren. But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers. Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren. Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/6.1-10?lang=eng#primary" target="_blank">1 Cor. 6:1-10</a>). Who, observing these things, would go to law distressing his brother, thereby giving rise to hardness, evil speaking, strifes and animosities among those who have covenanted to keep the commandments of God--who have taken upon them the name of Saints, and if Saints are to judge angels, and also to judge the world--why then are they not competent to judge in temporal matters, especially in trivial cases, taking the law of the Lord for their guide, brotherly kindness, charity, &amp;c., as well as the law of the land? Brethren, these are evils which ought not to exist among us. We hope the time will speedily arrive when these things will be done away, and everyone stand in the office of his calling, as a faithful servant of God. building each other up, bearing each other's infirmities, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</p>

<p>Letter of G. Walker to Elder Brigham Young et al.--Affairs in England since Departure of the Apostles.</p>
<p>Manchester, England, Jan. 29, 1842.</p>
<p><em>To President Young, Elders Kimball and Richards.</em></p>
<p>Beloved Brethren:--Soon after your departure, a clergyman of the church of England called upon my employer, to request that he might have an interview with me, as he had a wish to propound certain questions to me; upon his request being complied with, we retired to a private room, when he produced a long list of questions, written down, opposite to which he wrote my answers. The rise of the Church, Priesthood, doctrines offices, sacraments, &amp;c., were the principal queries he advanced. When he demurred to any of our principles I was proceeding to explain, he cut my discourse short by saying he would not hold any controversy, his object being only to obtain information. After the disposal of his queries, he wished to be informed where he could obtain the whole of the publications of the Latter-day Saints, as he wished to be in possession of them; I informed him at 47 Oxford street, Manchester, and he promised to send for them.</p>
<p><a name="506" id="506"></a>[Page 506]</p>
<p>Soon after the visit of this reverend gentleman, I had reason to suspect that undermining operations were in progress against me, I therefore tendered my resignation to the directors, but they would not accept it; and very soon after a public accountant was employed by them to investigate their accounts for several years back, and I was happy to be able to answer satisfactorily every question that was asked of me respecting them.</p>
<p>After this another minister sent a lengthy article extracted from an American paper, purporting to be the production of a Mr. Anthon, with a request that I would "read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest" the same. I replied to the statements of Mr. Anthon, and after disposing of them paragraph for paragraph, I told him that I was obliged by his favoring me with it, inasmuch as it satisfied my mind, and was confirmatory of the prediction of Isaiah being fulfilled, seeing that Mr. Anthon admitted that "the words of the book were delivered to the learned," &amp;c. I then proceeded to contrast the church of England with churches established by the Apostles; but he has not acknowledged the receipt of my letter as yet. The clergy are building ten new churches in this town and neighborhood, and are employing additional curates to go round to the houses of their parishoners, to coerce or intimidate them into an attendance upon their services in fulfillment of the words of Paul, In the last days perilous times will come, &amp;c., that they would have a form of godliness, but deny the power, and would creep into houses to lead captive silly women," &amp;c. (See 2 Timothy, 1st chapter, 1st to 8th verses.) These curates make repeated visits generally when the heads of families are from home, and take special care to enquire where the family are employed, and what place of worship they attend, &amp;c., and leave tracts for the family to read.</p>
<p>One of the Rev. Hugh Stowell's curates has paid several visits to my house, but always in my absence, although he was requested to call when I was at home, and informed of the time when he might meet with me.</p>
<p><a name="507" id="507"></a>[Page 507]</p>
<p>The following discourse took place in our own neighborhood: Curate: What religion may you be, my good woman? I am a churchwoman, sir. What church do you usually attend? I never attend any, sir.</p>
<p>After reprimanding the woman for pretending to be one of his flock, while she absented herself from the fold, he went to the house of a poor woman who had lately joined the Saints. I am a minister of the Church of Jesus Christ in England, and have called to inquire what school you send your children to, and what religion you profess? The woman replied she was a "Latter-day Saint." "Oh! delusion, delusion!" he rejoined, and began to rail against the Saints, whereupon she handed him the Bible, and requested him to read the place where she casually opened to, namely the third chapter of Micah, and to preach a discourse from that part of the Bible; but he retreated from before her and has not troubled her since.</p>
<p>The Lord Bishop of Chester and the Protestant clergymen, have hired a person of the name of Brindley to go about lecturing against the Saints, and have commenced a monthly periodical in which the foul slanders heaped upon the Saints in America and elsewhere are retailed out to satisfy the malice of the enemies of truth. TheÂ <em>Manchester Courier</em>Â has had several articles against our society and principles, and the old Spaulding romance has been resuscitated for the occasion. The Rev. Charles Burton, Doctor of Laws, minister of "All Saints," has been several times to see me lately, and upon one occasion invited me to his house, where I went and discussed our principles for several hours, until he was glad to withdraw from the contest; I found him ignorant in a great measure of what the Bible contains respecting the latter-days. He admitted that the Saints would reign on earth.</p>
<p>The great work of the Lord is still progressing in spite of all the opposition of lying priests and their auxiliaries of the newspaper press. I baptized Elizabeth Smith, who resided with us when you were in England, and she purposes coming out to America along with us.</p>
<p>There is very great distress among the operatives and the poor generally, and great excitement respecting the agitation of the repeal of the corn laws. Great fires have frequently occurred at the commencement of this year; a large carrier's warehouse was consumed by fire, about from 200,000 to 300,000 ($1,000,000 to $1,500,000) worth of cotton and grain, &amp;c., destroyed. It was the Union Company's carrying ware house, Piccadilly. There is great depression in almost every branch of manufactures, and great perplexity; and I am daily more and more convinced that the time is not far distant when Babylon the great will be fallen and become a desolation, and the kings and the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her, and she will be cast down, even as a great mill-stone cast into the sea, and will be found no more at all.</p>

<p>I opened a place for preaching at Blakesley, about six week's ago; and there were three baptized and confirmed there last week. I was with Elder John Brotherton at Middleton on Sunday last, where he and Elder Hardman had obtained a room to preach to the Chartists.Â <a href="https://byustudies-dev.byu.edu/hc/4/30.html#fn-6">6</a>Â We have also a place opened at Disbury and Heaton.</p>
<p>About three weeks ago there was a letter inserted in theÂ <em>Manchester Courier,</em>Â by a writer who signs himself R P., calling upon the clergymen of the church of England, and the respectable inhabitants, and the most respectable and intelligent of the police, to attend our meetings at the Carpenters' Hall, as they had fondly hoped that the system would have fallen to the ground by the weight of its own absurdity; but they found that there was method and consistency in the apparent madness of these deluded people, and that experience had taught them that such expectations were vain; as they had observed that there was considerable consistency displayed, and method attending our arrangements, there being an emigration office established in this town, &amp;c. The writer suspected there was a genuine American trick being practiced by the interested parties at the head of the system, to decoy the ignorant and unwary to perish in the swamps of New Orleans, and that they were draining the country of their best artists; and it was high time some steps were taken to put a stop to such practices.</p>
<p>We have since discovered that the writer is no other than Robert Philips, Esq., an extensive manufacturer and merchant, brother to Mark Philips, Esq., another great manufacturer and member of parliament for the Borough of Manchester. The editor of theÂ <em>Courier</em>Â has been playing upon the same string for several weeks since, and feels satisfied that from the exposure he has given the whole system, it must inevitably die away. He was therefore satisfied with having done his duty, and could safely leave them to the management of the proper parties, and recommend the police to do their duty. It appears that the gallant officer at the head of the police (Sir Charles Shaw), has too much discretion and good sense to be set on like a dog to worry out a society of Christians, because the editor of the Puseyite Oracle pointed the finger of scorn at them, because they dared to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences. I should have liked very well for the police to have been there on Sunday last, for three persons had to be put out by the brethren for disturbing the meeting in the sacrament services.</p>

<p>I remain, beloved brethren, your brother and fellow laborer,</p>
<p>G. Walker.</p>
<p>P. S.--I omitted to say that the writer in the paper alluded to, informed the public that he was endeavoring to obtain information respecting the movements of the people. He had previously sent a person to Elder Pratt to get him to state something in writing respecting emigration, and after the publication of the letter before referred to, he again sent to Elder Pratt for additional information in writing. I happened to be at Elder Pratt's when he made the second application, and I told Elder Pratt that he was the individual who had published the letter in theÂ <em>Courier.</em>Â Elder Pratt sent him another letter containing the required information; and also stated that he had no objection to submit to him, or to the government of this country, or any of its departments, the religious principles of our society, our place of emigration, and indeed the whole of our movements in this and other countries, for the strictest investigation.</p>
<p>The manufacturers are evidently beginning to be jealous of the mechanics and workmen emigrating with people having so systematic an organization as the Latter-day Saints display in their arrangements in this town.</p>
<p>I remain yours, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a name="fn-1" id="fn-1"></a>1. Peter Maughan was born May 7, 1811, at Breckenridge, in the parish of Parley, county of Cumberland, England. He married Miss Ruth Harrison in 1829. He was baptized into the Church by Elder Isaac Russell in 1838, and emigrated to Nauvoo with his family of six children, now motherless, his wife having died in 1841. He came on the shipÂ <em>Rochester,</em>Â in company with Brigham Young and several other members of the quorum of the Twelve on their return home. He was a man of keen intelligence and commanding personal influence.</p>
<p><a name="fn-2" id="fn-2"></a>2. Cabul is the capital of Afghanistan, situated on the river Kabul. It is noted as a commercial and strategic center, and the event named in the text above is an incident in what is usually called the first Afghan War. While the British were compelled to evacuate the place, as stated in the text, they re-took it in September following.</p>

<p><a name="fn-4" id="fn-4"></a>4. The article from theÂ <em>Star</em>Â here referred to is insertedÂ <em>in extenso,</em>Â and that for the reason that so many letters of Elder Hyde's concerning his journey to Jerusalem have already appeared in this volume, that this one seems necessary to the completion of the history of that mission, which must be regarded as an important movement on the part of the Church at this period.</p>
<p><a name="fn-5" id="fn-5"></a>5. George W. Gee was the first son of Solomon and Sarah W. Gee, born in Rome, Ashtabula county, Ohio, August 13, 1815. Was baptized at Kirtland, Geauga county, Ohio, February 17, 1833. Married Mary Jane Smith in Kirtland, February 5, 1838, by whom he had two sons named Elias S. and George W. Went to Caldwell county, Missouri, 1838. Was driven out by a mob in the spring of 1839. Went to Nauvoo, and was ordained an Elder in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, at the first conference held at Nauvoo, in October, 1839. Removed to Ambrosa, Lee county, Iowa, where he was appointed postmaster and deputy county surveyor; he surveyed the city plats of Nashville and Zarahemla, under the direction of President Joseph Smith. Was sent by the fall conference in 1841, to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he died, January 20, 1842, while in discharge of his duties, having won the affections of all the Saints with whom he had become acquainted, by his integrity and perseverance. His opportunity for schooling had been limited, but by his own exertion he attained to an excellent education, and collected quite a respectable library.</p>
<p><a name="fn-6" id="fn-6"></a>6. "Chartism" and the "Chartist," may be said to have come into existence early in the reign of Queen Victoria, in consequence of the formal declarations of the leaders of the Liberal Party in parliment not to proceed further in the reforms to which it was generally understood they were pledged. "Quietly studied now," says Justin McCarthy (1878) "the people's charter does not seem a very formidable document. There is so little smell of gun-powder about it. Its 'points' as they were called were six:" Manhood suffrage; annual parliaments; vote by ballot; abolition of the "property qualification" for members of parliament; payment of the members of parliament; and the division of the country into equal electoral districts. "There's your charter," said Daniel O'Connel, to the secretary of the Workingmen's Association--"There's your charter, agitate for it, and never be content with anything less." It was this circumstance that gave the movement and to its supporters the same "chartism" and "chartists." "Nothing," to again quopte McCarthy, "can be more unjust than to represent the leaders and promoters of the movement as mere factions and self-seeking demagogues. Some of them were impassioned young poets drawn from the class whom Kingsley has described in 'Alton Locke;' some were men of education; many were earnest and devoted fanatics; and so far as we can judge, all, or nearly all, were sincere."Â <em>History of Our Own Times,</em>Â Vol. I, Chapter V. This to show that the preaching of the Elders of the Church to the "Chartists," was no effort to unite Church work with any wild and disorderly political movement in England.</p>
