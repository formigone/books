<p>Preliminary Steps to the Forthcoming Prosecution of the Murderers of Joseph and Hyrum Smith--The Work in the Society Islands--Temple Affairs--Financial Embarrassment</p>
<p><em>"Wednesday, October 9, 1844 (continued):</em>--Governor Ford wrote the following:</p>
<p>Letter of Governor Ford Authorizing the Use of the Nauvoo Legion for Protection of the Courts</p>
<p>'State of Illinois, Executive Department,</p>
<p>Springfield, October 9th, 1844.</p>
<p><em>To Lieutenant-General Brigham Young of the Nauvoo Legion:</em></p>
<p><em>Sir:</em> It may be probable that there may be further disturbances in Hancock county by those opposed to the prosecutions against the murderers of Joseph and Hyrum Smith. They may combine together in arms to subvert justice and prevent those prosecutions from going on. They may also attack or resist the civil authorities of the state in that county and they may attack some of the settlements or people there with violence.</p>
<p>The sheriff of the county may want a military force to guard the court and protect it or its officers or the jurors thereof or the witnesses attending court from the violence of a mob.</p>
<p>In all these cases you are hereby ordered and directed to hold in readiness a sufficient force under your command of the Nauvoo Legion to act under the direction of the said sheriff for the purposes aforesaid; and also to suppress mobs which may be collected in said county to injure the persons or property of any of the citizens. In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and affixed the seal of state the day and year first herein above written.</p>
<p>[Signed] Thomas Ford,</p>
<p>Governor and Commander-in-Chief.'</p>

<p>Note Accompanying the Governor's Letter</p>
<p>'The enclosed order is one of great delicacy to execute. I have conversed with Mr. Backenstos and others and my opinion is the same as theirs that employing the Legion even legally may call down the vengeance of the people against your city. It if should be the means of getting up a civil war in Hancock I do not know how much force I could bring to the aid of government. A force to be efficient would have to be called out as volunteers; a draft would bring friends and enemies alike. I called for twenty-five hundred before and by ordering out independent companies got four hundred and seventy-five. Three of those companies, the most efficient, have since been broken up and would refuse to go again. I should anticipate but a small force to be raised by volunteers. I would not undertake to march a drafted militia there. Two-thirds of them would join the enemy. The enclosed order is more intended as a permission to use the Legion in the manner indicated, if upon the whole matter it is thought advisable, than a compulsory command.</p>
<p>Your most wise and discreet councilors and county officers will have to act according to their best judgment.</p>
<p>[Signed] Thomas Ford.'</p>
<p><em>Thursday, 10.</em>--Elder Heber C. Kimball and myself spent most of the day at Father Ezra Chase's.</p>
<p><em>Friday, 11.</em>--Evening, I attended prayer meeting at Elder Kimball's.</p>
<p><em>Saturday, 12.</em>--I met with the city council.</p>
<p><em>Sunday, 13.</em>--Meeting at the stand; Elder Parley P. Pratt preached.</p>
<p>The seventies met at their hall; Elder Orson Pratt preached and instructed the seventies in relation to their duties.</p>
<p><strong>President Young's Visit to the East.</strong></p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 15.</em>--Accompanied by Elder Heber C. Kimball and my brother Lorenzo D. Young I started for Ottoway. We traveled to Ramus and stayed with Brother Erastus Bingham, where Parley P. Pratt joined us.</p>
<p>A meeting of delegates from Trades Committees was held in the Masonic Hall, Nauvoo, John Taylor chairman; at which it was reported that enough had been made manifest to ensure the practicability of making Nauvoo a great manufacturing depot.</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 16.</em>--Accompanied by the brethren before named I traveled to Brother Justus Ames's near Galesburg, forty miles. Next day, we traveled to LaFayette and stayed with Brother Austin Grant, and on the following day traveled to Providence encountering a wet snowstorm from which I took cold and suffered from diarrhea: we stayed at a tavern.</p>
<p><a name="311" id="311"></a>[Page 311]</p>
<p><em>Saturday, 19.</em>--We drove forty-four miles and arrived at Ottoway.</p>
<p><em>Sunday, 20.</em>--We held two meetings at Brother Busard's.</p>
<p>Elders Heber C. Kimball and Parley P. Pratt and I preached: we had a profitable time.</p>
<p>The seventies met in their hall at Nauvoo.</p>
<p><strong>Large Party of Witnesses From Nauvoo go to Carthage.</strong></p>
<p>After ordaining presidents who had been selected to preside over the quorums, a call was made by request of the major-general for thirty wagons and teams to be in readiness at the hall by daylight tomorrow, with three days' provisions and horse feed sufficient for the journey. This call was made to convey witnesses to Carthage in safety, and for protection during the trials at court: as two of our best men were murdered in Carthage in June and that too under the faith and pledge of the state and since caution is the parent of safety, it was deemed inadvisable to venture upon the pledges and promises of others.</p>
<p><em>Monday, 21.</em>--About one hundred and fifty brethren went from Nauvoo to Carthage early this morning and encamped near Crooked Creek; although they exhibited no arms their appearance created much excitement. The company consisted of the city council, police and those concerned in abating the <em>Nauvoo Expositor</em> nuisance with the witnesses and others who had business in Carthage: by encamping they avoided the necessity of paying hotel bills to enemies and the risk of being murdered in their beds.</p>
<p>With the brethren accompanying me I dined at Brother Reuben Miller's, crossed Fox river and proceeded to Brother Dunavan's and remained all night.</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 22.</em>--We visited the Norwegian branch in La Salle county, and met with the saints in the evening.</p>
<p><a name="312" id="312"></a>[Page 312]</p>
<p>Misconduct of William Smith <em>et. al</em> Reported.</p>
<p>I received a lengthy communication from Elder Wilford Woodruff relative to the injudicious course pursued by Elders William Smith, George J. Adams and Samuel Brannan.</p>
<p>A correspondent wrote from Carthage to the <em>Nauvoo Neighbor</em> as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Mob Movements at Carthage.</strong></p>
<p>'Court is in session. The mob is here but not in great numbers. They are fierce and vindictive and disposed to do harm if they dare. They had a violent warlike meeting in the courthouse last night, in which they tried to get up a story that there were two hundred Mormons and three hundred Indians encamped near this place in hostile array for the purpose of an attack on the town. They passed panic resolutions, advising the court to adjourn and threatened if that was not done that they would raise an armed force as they say to protect themselves, but as all know, for the purpose of awing the court and juries and driving off witnesses. Roosevelt, Sharp, Williams and company were the leaders in getting up the excitement. They hope to get it believed abroad that they are about to be attacked by the Mormons as an excuse for some outrage which they wish, but have not the courage to perpetrate.'</p>
<p><strong>A Norwegian Branch Organized.</strong></p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 23.</em>--In company with Elder Heber C, Kimball, Parley P. Pratt and Lorenzo D. Young, I called the brethren together as a conference principles of the Norwegian branch. We taught the gospel to them and appointed George P. Dykes, high priest, to preside over the Norwegian branch and the saints in that vicinity of country, and ordained Reuben Miller a bishop,</p>
<p>We bought one hundred acres of land from Brothers Goodman and Anderson, and thereupon laid out a city. We selected the ground for a meetinghouse and drove the southeast corner stake. We called the city Norway and dedicated it to the Lord. Evening, we ordained Brother Phillip Hammond Busard a high priest and set him apart as a counselor to Brother Dykes.</p>
<p><em>Thursday, 24.</em>--We left Ottoway and drove forty-three miles to Brother Parley P. Pratt's farm. We found his brother, Anson Pratt, and family well: they were glad to see us.</p>
<p><a name="313" id="313"></a>[Page 313]</p>
<p><strong>Return of the Nauvoo Witnesses.</strong></p>
<p>The brethren who went to Carthage returned home to Nauvoo. The members of the city council who were not indicted by the grand jury, were released from their bonds; eleven brethren were indicted for riot: the judge and attorney advised the brethren to return to Nauvoo to allay the excitement. The trials are continued until next spring term of court: the Nauvoo Legion is a terror.</p>
<p>Brother Hyrum Smith prophesied that the governor would call upon the Nauvoo Legion to maintain the supremacy of the law, which has been fulfilled according to [by] the governor's late order.</p>
<p><strong>Willard Richards Subpoenaed a Witness at the Carthage Trial.</strong></p>
<p>Willard Richards was subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury, but being unable and unwilling to go to Carthage application was made to the court to get an attachment for his person, the attorney averring that it was necessary to have someone to prove that Joseph and Hyrum were dead, and he presumed that Richards was in possession of that knowledge; the court however refused the attachment as they considered that fact could be proved without bringing a sick man out of his bed. The Twelve all left Nauvoo during the court except Elder Willard Richards who was confined to his bed, and Elder George A. Smith who gave such counsel as the excitement of the times required.</p>
<p>Work In Society Islands Reported</p>
<p>Elder Noah Rogers wrote from Huahine, Society Islands, of date as follows:</p>
<p>'I have left Tahiti and am now on the Island of Huahine, which is about ninety or one hundred miles distant. The work on Tahiti has got a good start. We baptized several whites, and several more said that they believed and would be baptized soon, and several natives told me when I left Tahiti that they meant to be baptized soon.</p>
<p>I left Brother Grouard there, who has got the language very well, and I have no doubt of his faithfulness, because he is a firm and faithful brother, and seeks the good of the kingdom of God.</p>
<p><a name="314" id="314"></a>[Page 314]</p>
<p>I have been but one week on Huahine. I expect soon to obtain a house and preach as there is one or two that show some disposition to assist me in getting one. Almost every white man on this island keeps a grogshop and a gambling house, which is a very bad example for the natives. If you say anything to them about it, they will say that the whites learned [taught] us. They are full of licentiousness, which the sailors are very willing to encourage. When I see so much iniquity and abomination, it makes me sick to the very heart, and I wonder that the Lord has spared the world so long as he has. There is but one missionary [i. e. sectarian] here, who rules the island, as it were. All the people say that he is a very nice man, but I cannot say so much of him as he refuses to talk with me.'</p>
<p><strong>President Young's Return to Nauvoo.</strong></p>
<p><em>Monday, 28.</em>--I returned to Nauvoo with my brethren, we found our families well. During our absence it was unknown to the people whither we had gone.</p>

<p><em>Friday, November 1, 1844.</em>--The seventies met at 10 a.m.; President Joseph Young took the lead of business. Brother Eleazur Miller was ordained a president and twenty brethren were ordained seventies. I addressed the meeting on the subject of Elections, and voting for party candidates.

<p><em>Sunday, 3.</em>--I went to the Seventies' Hall in the forenoon, attended the high priests' quorum in the afternoon, and met again with the seventies in the evening.</p>
<p>At a conference held in Livonia, Wayne county, Michigan, on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd inst., fourteen branches were represented, five elders volunteered to go and preach the gospel, and a resolution was passed to sustain the Twelve and all the authorities in carrying out the commandments of God that have been given through Joseph Smith, our martyred Prophet. The sacrament was administered, and much instruction given on the first principles of the gospel. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-1">1</a></p>
<p><em>Thursday, 7.</em>--With Elders John Taylor and George A. Smith, I visited the Trustees, afterwards visited at Brother Joseph Bates Noble's with Elder Amasa M. Lyman, Sister Olive Frost and others.</p>

Elders John Taylor and Orson Spencer addressed the meeting.</p>
<p>William Clayton recorded the following:</p>
<p>'As I was walking along Front Street, St. Louis, I saw a man engaged cutting a stone monument. I was amazed to see these words already cut on the monument, <em>viz.</em> 'Highwater June 27th, 1844,' that was the day when this generation rejected the Prophet of God, when he and his brother Hyrum, the Patriarch, were murdered at Carthage jail by a wicked mob, and this was the day when the waters overflowed the Missouri at the highest, when the Front Street of St. Louis was covered eight feet deep with the flood.'</p>

<p>Eleven a.m., seventies met in their hall, Joseph Young presiding; sixteen brethren were ordained seventies; Elder George A. Smith preached at length on the subject of Apostasy.</p>
<p><em>Monday, 2.</em>----I extract from the <em>Times and Seasons</em> (p. 728) the following:--</p>
<p>A Voice from the Temple</p>
<p>By the Temple Committee</p>
<p><strong>Change of Office Location.</strong></p>
<p>'We would say to all those who wish to bring tithes for the building of the Temple in the city of Nauvoo, that we have deemed it wisdom to remove our office, for the better accommodation of business, and of all who visit us on business, to the new and commodious brick store of Elder Parley P. Pratt, situated one block north from the west end of the Temple; at which place we will attend every day in the week (Sunday excepted) from morning till evening, to receive donations for the Temple and also attend to all other matters of business pertaining to the Trustees. We publish this notice that the brethren may not need to inquire where they shall deposit their donations. We have only one place of deposit in the city of Nauvoo and that is the above mentioned brick store.</p>
<p><strong>A Word of Caution Against Frauds.</strong></p>
<p>We would also once more offer a word of caution to all the saints for their benefit, inasmuch as there are those who are going round amongst the branches of the church to collect funds for the Temple without authority, and who are all the while practicing impositions upon the brethren. They generally use the property for their own individual benefit, and make no returns of it to us, and consequently when the donors come to see the records their names are not there. Many have felt to censure us on this account, but censure in such a case is unjust, for we have published notices repeatedly, warning the saints not to credit any man's testimony as to his being an agent unless he can show written authority from us or the Quorum of the Twelve, and all those who entrust their means in the hands of unauthorized agents, do it at their own risk, and not ours.</p>
<p><strong>The Right to Demand Identification of Agents.</strong></p>
<p>The presiding elders in the branches have a right to call for, and to see the authority of any and every man professing to be an agent for the church, and if he is an honest servant and a man of authority he will always be ready to produce his testimonials to proper authority, but if he is an impostor he will either make excuses, or he will probably scorn at the idea of your questioning a man of God as to his authority. In some instances men have considered themselves insulted when asked by the presiding elders for their authority, but this is only an evidence either of their own wickedness, or that they come on an errand on which they were never legally sent. Beware of wolves in sheep's clothing!</p>
<p><a name="319" id="319"></a>[Page 319]</p>
<p>We are more particular on this subject because there have been instances, not a few, wherein men who are not Latter-day Saints, but on the contrary our most bitter enemies, have gone round gulling the churches and professing to be 'Mormons' and agents to collect funds for the building of the 'Temple and Nauvoo House', etc.; and they have taken advantage of the liberality of the brethren by all kinds of fine speeches and persuasive inducements to get away with their money, until they have accomplished their objects, and then they become 'missing'. It is not our wish to see the brethren cheated so barefacedly after all the persecutions we have suffered, and we once more repeat the caution, be wise and careful.</p>
<p>There are instances where the saints rarely see an authorized agent, in consequence of the distance from Nauvoo, or, in consequence of their residing some distance from a regularly organized branch. In such cases, when they want to send up their donations, let them do it by some man with whom they are well acquainted, and who they are well satisfied will do right, and carry their donation safe to its destination. And it would be well in all cases, where the brethren abroad send donations by authorized agents, to send a letter by mail (post paid), to the Trustees-in-Trust, informing them of the facts, and by whom their donations were sent, etc., and a good man will not blame you for being thus careful, for the same law that guards your rights will guard his rights, and the rights of every man.</p>
<p><strong>List of Church Agents to be Published.</strong></p>
<p>It is our intention for the future to publish the names of our agents in the <em>Nauvoo Neighbor</em> and the <em>Times and Seasons,</em> which we consider to be safer and better than written authority, inasmuch as he latter can be 'forged', but the former can not, and the agents can carry a copy to the paper, having their authority with them wherever they go.</p>
<p><strong>Promised Change of Labor for Money.</strong></p>
<p>There is also another subject which we would touch upon in this notice. There have been instances wherein men have gone amongst the branches of the church, collecting money and agreeing to pay the same amount in labor on the Temple, which they represent will answer as good a purpose as the money. We have to say on this subject that all such transactions are regarded as fraud, and is only a more crafty way of cheating the brethren. It would be folly for us to tell a man that ten days labor on the Temple would answer the law of tithing as well as ten dollars in money, when he was possessed of one hundred dollars in money. We know better, and every faithful brother and sister in the church will know better when they understand the principles of salvation as well as old Abraham, Isaac and Jacob did. For Jacob said of all thou givest me, one-tenth I will give unto thee, and whoever will read the history of the ancients with care will find that the law was, that they must pay one-tenth of all in its kind, whether cattle, horses, sheep, or fruits of the field. 'Tis true there were laws of redemption, whereby a man might redeem 'ought of his tithing' but it was so strict, that it is far easier to pay the tithing in kind rather than redeem it.</p>
<p><a name="320" id="320"></a>[Page 320]</p>
<p>Jesus said, all who do the works of Abraham are the children of Abraham, and he (Abraham) paid tithes of all. The Savior also said to the Pharisees, 'ye pay tithes of mint and annis and cummin, but neglect the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy and faith, these ought ye to have done, and not have left the others undone'.</p>
<p>We make reference to these subjects that the brethren may take the hint, and think for themselves for just so sure as there are laws established from before the foundation of the world for the government of the Church of Christ just so sure will we fail of obtaining a fulness of salvation if we do not abide by those laws. No man can obtain a celestial glory if he will not abide a celestial law, and the law of tithing is a celestial law, and always was in force where the Melchizedek priesthood was inherited.</p>
<p><strong>Operation of the Law of Tithing.</strong></p>
<p>Why did the Savior say, 'how hardly shall they that have riches enter the kingdom of heaven?' Just converse with a rich man upon the subject of tithing, and you will soon see a reason why the rich can hardly enter the kingdom of heaven. When you converse with a man who has got ten thousand dollars in money in his hands, and tell him that his tithing will be one thousand dollars in money, you generally will see the force of the words of Jesus. That man would consider himself almost ruined if he should donate his one thousand dollars, whereas a man who has only ten dollars in money in the world, will come forward with cheerfulness and donate his tenth with joy. Remember the widow with her two mites.</p>
<p><strong>The Saints Will Desire to Know.</strong></p>
<p>No man or woman who really desires to secure a fulness of salvation will wish to be kept ignorant of those principles, and laws and ordinances on which his salvation depends, and consequently we are free to give a hint on the subject of tithing upon us to instruct the people, but because we realize in some measure the importance of it ourselves to set the saints to 'thinking for themselves' on the subject.</p>
<p><strong>The Twelve Willing to Impart Instructions.</strong></p>
<p>When the saints ask for instructions, the Twelve are the proper authorities to refer to, and they will deal it out as fast as the saints are willing to obey.</p>
<p><strong>Progress on the Temple.</strong></p>
<p>We are happy to have to say that the Temple has progressed more rapidly than our most sanguine expectations could have imagined. All the capitals are on the walls, except one, which if the weather permit, will be up in a few days. The weather has been remarkably favorable and continues so to the present. The feelings of the saints are good and their hearts are cheered while they look upon the House of God and reflect on the prospects of its speedy completion. Their toils and poverty and persecutions are all swallowed up in the cheering prospects of their reward, only a little ways ahead.</p>
<p><a name="321" id="321"></a>[Page 321]</p>
<p><strong>Status of the Saints and the Work at Nauvoo.</strong></p>
<p>Peace smiles upon our beloved city. And the great God looks down upon this people with sympathy and compassion from day to day, dispensing his heavenly blessings upon all the families of his saints according to his infinite wisdom and their willingness to receive them. The hearts of the saints are united firmer than ever, notwithstanding the vigorous efforts made by satan and dissenters to sow amongst us discord, strife, and confusion, and every evil work, scattering not excepted. Many houses are in progress of erection, which on account of the lateness of the season will have to stand unfinished until next spring. Every effort is being made to establish and put in operation various branches of manufacture for the employment of the saints, and the prospects are good, but not unattended with difficulty, toil and anxiety. But diligence, economy, and steady perseverance in a good cause, never fails to bring its reward, and very often the sweetest roses are surrounded by the sharpest thorns, and the greatest treasures deposited in places the most difficult of access, where we have to dig, and dig long and deep in order to obtain them.</p>
<p><strong>Benediction.</strong></p>
<p>We might prolong these remarks, but perhaps we have said enough for once. We will leave the subject, praying the blessings of our heavenly Father to rest upon all good men, and especially upon the saints, that they may have peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, and attain to that knowledge which will obtain for them an inheritance in the eternal kingdom of our God.</p>
<p>We have the honor to be</p>
<p>Your most obedient servants, and brethren in the faith of Christ,</p>
<p>N. K. Whitney,<br />
George Miller,<br />
Trustees-in-Trust.</p>
<p>By Wm, Clayton, Recorder.<br />
Nauvoo, Dec. 2, 1844.'</p>
<p><em>Monday, December 2, (continued).</em>--I attended a council at Elder Willard Richards: present--the brethren of the Twelve, the Trustees; the Temple Committee and architect. The duties of the Temple Committee and architect were explained.</p>
<p>Evening; the Presidents of Seventies met.</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 3.</em>--City police met. Captain Hosea Stout instructed them pertaining to their duties.</p>
<p><em>Thursday, 5.</em>--I insert the following minutes:</p>
<p><a name="322" id="322"></a>[Page 322]</p>
<p>Council Minutes of Financial AffairsÂ <strong>Action on Finance.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Action on Finance.</strong></p>
<p>'Afternoon, a council was held in the recorder's office, President Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball of the Quorum of the Twelve were present, also N. K. Whitney and George Miller, Trustees and Alpheus Cutler and Reynolds Cahoon, the Temple Committee. The council was called for the purpose of devising means to raise the sum of $3,100, which is due from the Trustees to several individuals for church lands, and which will have to be paid within three months or the lands be forfeited, worth from ten to fifteen thousand dollars. About one thousand dollars of the aforesaid sum must be paid in a few days. After conversing some time on the prospects of raising funds, President Young said that his feelings were to draw the money lying in the possession of Sisters Mary Smith and Mercy R. Thompson and A. Cutler, which money has been donated by the sisters of the church, by paying one cent a week, for the purpose of purchasing the nails and glass for the Temple and which amounted to five or six hundred dollars already collected. It is considered wisdom to do this to save the church property from the hands of our enemies; and the straitened circumstances under which the Trustees labor in consequence of persecution and oppression--we consider sufficient to justify the course. It is also considered certain that the money will be ready by the time the nails and glass are needed for the Temple, and that the money will be saving so much interest, whereas at the present it is lying useless. The suggestion by President Young seemed to meet the feelings of all the brethren, and it was concluded to draw an order for the money on Mrs. Mary Smith, and Mercy R. Thompson, which was immediately done.'</p>
<p>Letter of President Young to Relief Society Presidency</p>
<p><em>"To Mrs. Mary Smith and Mercy R. Thompson,</em></p>
<p><em>Dear Sisters:</em></p>
<p>We are under the necessity of raising a considerable sum of money for the use of the church within a few days. We have counseled together on the subject, and have considered it wisdom to call upon you for the money in your hands, donated by the sisters as penny subscription. You will therefore please deliver the same to Bishop Whitney when he presents this order.</p>
