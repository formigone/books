<p>The Return to Winter Quarters--The Organization of and Universal Acceptance of the First Presidency of the Church, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and Willard Richards--1847-8--President Young's Last Journey over the Plains</p>
<p>After having settled the Pioneer Company and the contingent Mormon Battalion, invalided sections, which had wintered at Pueblo, and who arrived in Salt Lake City five days after the Pioneer Company, President Young, a number of the Twelve Apostles, (a majority), and some of the Pioneer Company returned to Winter Quarters late in 1847 to further the migration of the saints still encamped on the Missouri frontiers.</p>
<p>Under date of October 30, 1847, President Young records in his <em>Manuscript History</em> the following:</p>
<p><em>"Saturday, October 30, 1847.</em>--At sunset about 20 wagons arrived from Winter Quarters with Bishop N. K. Whitney, John S. Fullmer, Wm. Kay and many friends, bringing food and grain.</p>
<p><em>Sunday, 31.</em>--When we were about one mile from Winter Quarters the wagons of the Twelve came to the front, when I remarked:</p>
<p><strong>The Thanks of the Leader--His Report of the Pioneer Journey.</strong></p>
<p>'Brethren, I will say to the Pioneers, I wish you to receive my thanks for your kindness and willingness to obey orders; I am satisfied with you: you have done well. We have accomplished more than we expected. Out of one hundred forty-three men who started, some of them sick, all of them are well; not a man has died; we have not lost a horse, mule, or ox, but through carelessness; the blessings of the Lord have been with us. If the brethren are satisfied with me and the Twelve, please signify it, (which was unanimously done). I feel to bless you all in the name of the Lord God of Israel. You are dismissed to go to your own homes.'</p>
<p><a name="617" id="617"></a>[Page 617]</p>
<p>We drove into the town in order, about an hour before sunset. The streets were crowded with people to shake hands as we passed through the lines; we were truly rejoiced to once more behold our wives, children and friends after an absence of over six months, having traveled over 2000 miles, sought out a location for the saints to dwell in [in] peace, and accomplished the most interesting mission in this last dispensation. Not a soul of our camp died, and no serious accident happened to any, for which we praise the Lord.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, November 3, 1847.</em>--The Twelve met in council at my house. John S. Fullmer reported the proceedings of the trustees in Nauvoo; when it was voted that the trustees gather all the papers and books pertaining to church affairs in Nauvoo, and as many of the poor saints together with as much church property as they can, and remove hither [i. e. Winter Quarters]. It was also voted that the saints in Garden Grove be advised to remove to Winter Quarters next spring.</p>

<p><em>Friday, 26.</em>--On the 26th I started from Winter Quarters on my journey to the mountains, leaving my houses, mills and the temporary furniture I had acquired during our sojourn there.

<p><a name="628" id="628"></a>[Page 628]</p>
<p><strong>Desolation of Winter Quarters.</strong></p>
<p>A terrific thunder storm passed over, accompanied by a hurricane which tore wagon covers to shreds and whistled fearfully through the empty dwellings. A few straggling Indians camped in the vacated premises and subsisted upon the cattle which had died by poverty and what [else] they [could] pick up.</p>
<p>Some Indians stole three oxen from John Scott, who, assisted by others, pursued them and recovered the beeves.</p>

<p>This acceptance by sustaining the action of a majority of the Quorum of the Twelve at Winter Quarters on the 5th of December, 1847, sustained also by the Annual Conference of the Church at Miller's Hollow (Council Point, at that particular conference named Kanesville, and subsequently Council Bluffs); and by all the branches in that region; by the church in Salt Lake valley, with more than 5000 members; and by the saints in conference assembled in Great Britain (then numbering, as stated in the text, 17,902 members); and by the churches in the Pacific Islands; completed the installation of Brigham Young and his counselors as the second First Presidency of the Church, of three Presiding High Priests, and bridges over the period of time and historic ground between the passing of the First Presidency in the administration of Joseph Smith, the Prophet, and the establishment again of the First Presidency by the selection and inauguration of Brigham Young, official Prophet in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. And with this, Period 2 of the <em>Documentary History of the Church</em> may be considered closed.</p>

<p><a name="fn-1" id="fn-1"></a>1. Destruction of the Mormon [Nauvoo] Temple</p>
<p><em>"November</em> 19, 1848: 'On Monday the 19th of November, our citizens were awakened by the alarm of fire, which, when first discovered, was bursting out through the spire of the Temple, near the small door that opened from the east side to the roof, on the main building. The fire was seen first about three o'clock in the morning, and not until it had taken such hold of the timbers and roof as to make useless any effort to extinguish it. The materials of the inside were so dry, and the fire spread so rapidly, that a few minutes were sufficient to wrap this famed edifice in a sheet of flame. It was a sight too full of mournful sublimity. The mass of material which had been gathered there by the labor of many years afforded a rare opportunity for this element to play off some of its wildest sports. Although the morning was tolerably dark, still, when the flames shot upwards, the spire, the streets, and the houses for nearly a mile distant were lighted up, so as to render even the smallest objects discernible. The glare of the vast torch, pointing skyward, indescribably contrasted with the universal gloom and darkness around it; and men looked on with faces sad as if the crumbling ruins below were consuming all their hopes.</p>
<p>It was evidently the work of an incendiary. There had been, on the evening previous, a meeting in the lower room: but no person was in the upper part where the fire was first discovered. Who it was, and what could have been his motives, we have now no idea. Some feeling infinitely more unenviable than that of the individual who put the torch to the beautiful Ephesian structure of old, must have possessed him. To destroy a work of art, at once the most elegant and the most renowned in its celebrity of any in the whole west, would, we should think, require a mind of more than ordinary depravity; and we feel assured that no one in this community could have been so lost to every sense of justice, and every consideration of interest as to become the author of the deed' <em>(Nauvoo Patriot).</em></p>
<p><em>November</em> 1, 1856: Lewis A. Bidamon, (who married Emma Smith, widow of the Prophet Joseph, on December 23, 1847), [L.D.S. Biographical Encyclopedia, Jenson, vol. 1, p. 692], landlord of the Nauvoo Mansion, Illinois, stated to Elders George A. Smith and Erastus Snow, that the inhabitants of Warsaw, Carthage, Pontusac and surrounding settlements in consequence of jealousy that Nauvoo would still retain its superior importance as a town and might induce the Mormons to return contributed a purse of five hundred dollars which they gave to Joseph Agnew in consideration of his burning the Temple; and that said Agnew was the person who set the building on fire.</p>
<p>Bidamon further stated, that the burning of the Temple had the effect of diminishing the importance of Nauvoo; for his 'Mansion' or 'Hotel' had not since the conflagration one-fourth the custom it previously had" (<em>History of Brigham Young, Ms.,</em> 1848. pp. 79-81).</p>
<p><a name="fn-2" id="fn-2"></a>2. En route from Salt Lake valley, President Young conversed with his brethren of the Apostles on the subject of reorganizing the First Presidency of the Church. His conversation with Elder Woodruff on the subject is thus related by the latter in his Journal:</p>
<p>"October 12, 1847.--I had a question put to me by President Young: What my opinion was concerning one of the Twelve Apostles being appointed as the President of the Church with his two counselors. I answered that a quorum like the Twelve who had been appointed by revelation, confirmed by revelation from time to time--I thought it would require a revelation to change the order of that quorum. [But] whatever the Lord inspires you to do in this matter. I am with you"(<em>Woodruff's Journal,</em> entry for October 12, 1847).</p>
<p>In some remarks made by President Young while in St. George in 1862, he said to Isaac Morley and Levi Jackman, who were present with him: "You are both Jackson county members and I want you to live to go back to Jackson county with me." He also said: "Here is Brother Woodruff [who was present], he was the first man that I felt by the spirit to speak to about the organization of the church [i. e. First Presidency of the Church] (<em>Wilford Woodruff's Journal,</em> August 23, 1862; also copied into <em>Brigham Young's History, Ms.,</em> same date, pp. 779-80).</p>
<p>Wilford Woodruff also records concerning this meeting at Orson Hyde's house, that before the choice of Brigham Young for President of the Church "many interesting remarks were made by the various individuals who spoke, [this included all the members of the Twelve present], and we were followed by President Young. After which Orson Hyde moved that Brigham Young be the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and that he nominate his two counselors, and they three form the First Presidency. Seconded by Wilford Woodruff and carried unanimously. President Young nominated Heber C. Kimball as his first counselor: seconded, and carried unanimously. President Young nominated Willard Richards as his second counselor: seconded, and carried unanimously" (<em>Woodruff's Journal,</em> entry for December 5, 1847).</p>
<p><a name="fn-3" id="fn-3"></a>3. This was a General Conference of the whole church from Winter Quarters, Kanesville and Council Bluffs. "The spirit of the Lord at this time." said Brigham Young a month later, "rested upon the people in a powerful manner, insomuch that the saints' hearts were filled with joy unspeakable: every power of their mind and nerve of their bodies was awakened." A dead silence reigned in the congregation while the President spoke following the vote which had been taken (See Letter of President Young to Orson Spencer, then in England, <em>Millennial Star,</em> vol. 10, p. 115).</p>
<p>Subsequently this action of the saints in the settlements on the Missouri river in conference assembled--being the largest number of church members in one body, with several high councils presiding in various divisions of the church in those settlements--was ratified by unanimous vote by the saints of Salt Lake valley and in the General Conference of the church held in that place on the 8th of October, 1848; there being about 5000 people in the valley by that time.</p>
<p>Elder Parley P. Pratt nominated Brigham Young at that conference as the First President of the Church and the motion was carried without a dissenting vote. (seeÂ <em>Comprehensive History of the Church,</em>Â Century 1, vol. 3, p. 318, note).</p>
<p>The action was also ratified by the saints of the British Isles in General Conference assembled at Manchester, England, August 14, 1848, at which there were present delegates from 28 different conferences with a membership of 17,902.
