<p>Sundry Events Grouped Together Looking to an Understanding with the State Government at Nauvoo--Harvest Feast at Nauvoo</p>
<p><em>"Wednesday, May 28, 1845.</em>--This morning the workmen commenced to raise the attic story of the Temple.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer and its Objective.</strong></p>
<p><em>Thursday, 29.</em>--Evening, met at Brother Richards' for prayer in company with Brothers Heber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde, Orson Pratt, Willard Richards, John Taylor, Amasa M. Lyman, N. K. Whitney, George Miller, Joseph Young and Levi Richards. Prayed that the Lord would overrule the movements of Wm. Smith who is endeavoring to ride the Twelve down; also that the Lord would overrule the proceedings of the mob so that we may dwell in peace until the Temple is finished.</p>
<p>The court at Carthage heard the lawyer's pleas on the defense in the case the state of Illinois <em>vs.</em> the murderers of Joseph and Hyrum Smith; the counsel for the defense exhibited a cruel and mendacious spirit. Calvin A. Warren of Quincy made the most inflammatory speech.</p>
<p><em>Friday, 30.</em>--I attended council with the Twelve at Elder Taylor's.</p>
<p>The jury at Carthage brought in a verdict of acquittal in favor of Levi Williams, Thomas C. Sharp, Mark Aldrich, Jacob C. Davis and William N. Grover--as we had anticipated: the court, attorneys, jury and bystanders being all fully satisfied of their guilt. <a class="footnote" href="#fn-1">1</a> Brother George D. Watt attended the trial and took lengthy minutes from which the following is extracted:</p>
<p><a name="421" id="421"></a>[Page 421]</p>
<p>George D. Watt's Report of the Carthage Trial</p>
<p>'District Court of Illinois,</p>
<p>Carthage, Hancock County, State of Illinois,</p>
<p>May 19, 1845.</p>
<p>The Hon. Richard M. Young of Quincy on the bench. The forenoon was spent in organizing. Adjourned at twelve p.m.</p>
<p>Court met at two p.m.</p>
<p>Colonel Levi Williams, Thomas C. Sharp, editor of the <em>Warsaw Signal,</em> Jacob C. Davis, state senator, Mark Aldrich and William N. Grover were held to bail with each other for sureties, in the sum of one thousand dollars each, to make their appearance in court each day of the term; they were indicted for the murder of Joseph Smith at Carthage jail on the twenty-seventh day of June, 1844.</p>
<p>The court decided that their case would be tried on Wednesday morning, May 21st.</p>
<p>Accordingly the sheriff notified the witnesses for both parties to make their appearance on said morning at seven o'clock; the court then proceeded to other business.</p>
<p>Wednesday Morning, May 21st.</p>
<p>Court opened.</p>
<p>The names of the counsel for the defense are as follows: William A. Richardson, O. H. Browning, Calvin A. Warren.</p>
<p>Josiah Lamborn, Esq. for the people.</p>
<p>Colonel Wm. A. Richardson presented before the court two affidavits drawn out by the defendants to quash the array. The charge of prejudice, consanguinity and partiality was preferred by these affidavits against the county commissioners, the sheriff and his deputies in the arrangement of the present panel of jurors; that their design was to hurt and prejudice the present trial, and thus endanger the lives of the defendants. On these grounds the defendants pleaded for the quashing of the array. After referring to the statute to show the provision made for such a proceeding he submitted to the court.</p>
<p>The attorney for the people then arose and made the following observations, <em>viz.:</em> That the doctrine advanced by Colonel Richardson was a novelty to him, as the affidavits of the defendants predicated no charge against the present panel of jurors, either individually or collectively; he showed from the statute that the array could not be quashed upon the above principle, neither did he believe the officers of the county could be discharged upon a mere <em>exparte</em> affidavit, but the charges ought to be made and affidavits filed and a trial had before the court. He said it was the first time he had heard of such a proceeding to quash the array, at the same time nothing alleged against it individually or collectively.</p>
<p><a name="422" id="422"></a>[Page 422]</p>
<p>He showed that the statute referred to by Colonel Richardson applied to civil and not criminal cases. He could not suffer the idea of having the panel quashed by the discharge of all the officers of the county upon a mere <em>exparte</em> affidavit, and that too made by five men indicted for murder. He asked for a precedent in all the experience of this state or any other in criminal cases; he defied them to produce a single case.</p>
<p>Mr. Browning, for the defense, said, that although there had not been a precedent in the United States for such a proceeding, the reason is there has never been a case like this in the United States. He contended that such a proceeding is fully warranted by the English statutes and the statutes of the United States, that in a case like this the county commissioners, the sheriff and his deputies can be discharged, and in their place can be appointed elisors for the purpose of choosing another jury.</p>
<p>The court ruled that the jury be discharged and elisors appointed.</p>
<p>The court then adjourned.</p>
<p>Thursday, May 22nd,</p>
<p>The court appointed Thomas H. Owen and William D. Abernethy elisors and they selected a full panel of jurors.</p>
<p>Four panels of jurors were successively called and out of the ninety-six men twelve were selected as a jury satisfactory to the defense.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamborn prosecuted before this jury in a manner which showed clearly to every bystander the certainty of the guilt of the prisoners who were honorably acquitted. Mr. Frank Worrell, who had command of the guard at the jail at the time of the massacre, being summoned as a witness, and being asked by the prosecuting attorney if the guard had their guns loaded with blank cartridges at the time of the attack on the jail refused to answer, assigning as a reason that he could not without incriminating himself.'</p>
<p>The <em>Nauvoo Neighbor</em> has the following:</p>
<p>The Carthage Assassins</p>
<p>'On Friday last the trial terminated, and the prisoners were acquitted in the case of Joseph Smith. This accords with the vote of the city council last July, that when the law failed to atone for the blood of our Prophet and Patriarch shed at Carthage on the 27th of June last by a mob, we would refer the case to God for a righteous judgment, and we have never varied from that intention. If those men had been found guilty it would have been a novel case and a violation of all the rules of the world in all martyr cases before.</p>
<p>The murderers of Joseph and Hyrum Smith can rest assured that their case, independent of all earthly tribunals, will be tried by the Supreme Judge of the Universe, who has said, vengeance is mine and I will repay.'</p>
<p><a name="423" id="423"></a>[Page 423]</p>
<p><em>Saturday, 31.</em>--Brother George D. Watt returned from Carthage. Threats were made that his minutes should never go to Nauvoo, but he succeeded in passing them out of the court room about every hour.</p>
<p>Calvin A. Warren [counsel for the defense] said that if the prisoners were guilty of murder he himself was guilty alleging that it was the public opinion that the Smiths ought to be killed, and public opinion made the laws consequently it was not murder to kill the Smiths.</p>
<p>Elder Orson Spencer made the following report:</p>
<p>Reported Interview with Governor Ford and Ex-Governor Reynolds</p>
<p>'By the appointment of the Twelve I went to Springfield, Illinois about the middle of June [a note in the manuscript changes this to 'the last of May'] in company with Brother Samuel Brannan in order to See Governor Ford. Immediately on our arrival we found his Excellency who received us politely and introduced us to the secretary of state, Mr. Campbell, and to ex-Governor Reynolds. After dinner we all repaired to the governor's office in the state house except Mr. Campbell. There we held a familiar interview for several hours; during which both governors spoke freely of the unreasonable prejudice of the people through the state especially in the southern part of it. They were requested to use their influence officially and personally to allay prejudice and rebut slanders that might ultimately endanger the safety of this people unless counteracted. Governor Reynolds said that he had attempted to speak in extenuation of the supposed faults of the saints at public meetings, but the people rudely resisted his efforts and accused him of being a 'Smithite' and a 'Mormon'; and he was seriously afraid they would mob us by making an attack by the cooperation of steamboats upon our city. Both governors strenuously urged the necessity that the saints should cease to gather in one place and also opposed my suggestion to buy out the anti-Mormons in the county. They alleged that we might spread through other counties as we had done in Hancock, which would increase the alarm in other counties and in the state generally. They said that our political influence was that which exasperated the people.</p>
<p>Governor Ford said he durst not trust the best militia in the state to defend the Mormons. They would go over to the side of the mob in the event of a collision. He said that even General Hardin could not be trusted in our defense against the mob. He further said that the conduct of Governor Boggs of Missouri was unlawful and barbarous and pledged himself never to act like him in driving the saints and confirmed a former pledge that he would never demand the leaders of this church on criminal writs to expose them to assassination as the Smiths had been, and to use his utmost endeavors to suppress all mobs. He said however that his official influence was only nominal, there was really no force in the government.</p>
<p><a name="424" id="424"></a>[Page 424]</p>
<p>Large masses of people that might assemble for violent and tumultuous purposes could not be restrained by any law or government.</p>
<p>He was then assured that it was our intention as soon as we could finish the Temple to send off many of our people to distant parts of the earth and in the course of eighteen months very many of our people would colonize distant parts; and we were ready from that time forth to sell our property as soon as practicable and commence removals, if the people round about would buy us out.'</p>
<p><em>Sunday, June 1, 1845.</em>--I attended meeting at the stand. Elder Heber C. Kimball preached.</p>
<p>[In the remarks of Elder Kimball the following occurs].</p>
<p>Discourse of Elder Kimball</p>
<p>'I will mention one thing that we united in prayer for and called upon the Father in the name of Jesus: that our enemies should not have power to come in here with vexatious writs, for his servants during this court, and they have not done it. Is not this a miracle? Yes; and we have asked for rain, and it has rained; and we have asked for God to heal the sick, and he has healed them, or they are mending in answer to our prayers. Are not these great blessings? Does not this prove that God is with this people? Yes, verily, his name is to be praised, if this people will feel the same interest for the building up of this kingdom, and for the erecting of those houses, his will will be done, and there is no power that can stay them, and when that is done, I am satisfied; I do not care if I go into the wilderness the next day.' <a class="footnote" href="#fn-2">2</a></p>
<p>Elder John Taylor followed [Elder Kimball] on the subject of our persecutions. I made a few remarks.</p>
<p>At four p.m. the Presidents of Seventies met and preached to each other, and ordained four presidents for the twenty-seventh quorum.</p>
<p>Evening, I met for council and prayer with Elders H. C. Kimball, Orson Pratt, Willard Richards, John E. Page, John Taylor, George A. Smith, Amasa M. Lyman, John Smith, N. K. Whitney, George Miller, Levi Richards, Joseph Young and Wm. Clayton. Voted that Brother Peter O. Hanson translate the <em>Doctrine and Covenants</em> and <em>Book of Mormon</em> into the Danish Norwegian language and that Elder Orson Pratt assist him. Voted that the Trustees give George D. Watt a quarter of a lot and build him a house and employ him as reporter for the church and let his labors go towards paying for his house and lot. We prayed that justice might overtake the murderers of Joseph and Hyrum and that George J. Adams be stopped in his mad career.</p>
<p><a name="425" id="425"></a>[Page 425]</p>
<p>A conference was held in Merthyr-Tydvil, Wales, Elder William Henshaw presided; forty had been baptized since the April conference, and the brethren felt determined to spread the gospel.</p>
<p>At a special conference held in Cincinnati, thirty-two members were represented.</p>
<p><em>Monday, 2.</em>--I met with the Twelve in council.</p>
<p><em>Thursday, 5.</em>--I met for prayer with the Twelve and other brethren.</p>
<p>Elder Parley P. Pratt wrote to the Twelve of date, as follows:</p>
<p>Elder Parley P. Pratt's Letter to the Twelve in Nauvoo--Conditions in New York City</p>
<p>'As it regards publishing in this city [New York], if all the political and religious influence and support we have combined will support a periodical, even allowing the editor to work for nothing and live on sawdust pudding, it will be more than we have yet done, or are likely to do at present. There is little prospect of a periodical being supported by church or state, even if we give our time <em>gratis,</em> and use the utmost economy; therefore to divide it and either of us succeed seems at present impracticable; and I doubt very much whether we can continue to publish. The churches are few in number, we decrease while you increase. The law of tithing, emigration, the strengthening and defense of the City of Joseph has occupied the attention and employed the energies of the saints so entirely, since we came from the west and laid before them their duty and the necessity of immediate action, that it seems almost vain to mention subscriptions for papers in this country. If they have a dollar to spare, it is handed in for tithing, or used for the purchase of arms, clothing and ammunition, or to help themselves to emigrate and settle in the west.</p>
<p><a name="426" id="426"></a>[Page 426]</p>
<p>Our teachings and influence, aided by yours and by the Spirit of God, have tended to produce this state of things, and it pleases us so well that we do not like to counteract it in the least; but it rather embarrasses us as to immediate means to clothe or to furnish us money for necessary expenses and involves us in debt, besides devoting our entire time.</p>
<p>I have become convinced that I can do no good here. The public are entirely indifferent, and will neither come to meeting, hear, nor read the truth. The saints are few, about fifty of them attended a Sunday meeting in a large hall, and perhaps half a dozen strangers come in and out to gaze and gape and wonder and perish.</p>
<p>I have labored hard for six months without an idle moment, and have used economy in living, traveling and clothing. I feel as if I was now done with this city, and nearly so with the nation. My garments are clear, if they all perish. If I tarry a little longer in the east it will necessarily be in Boston and vicinity, where there is more interest manifested for the truth.'</p>
<p><em>Saturday, 7.</em>--Elder W. Woodruff visited the saints in London and secured the copyright of the <em>Book of Doctrine and Covenants</em> at Stationer's Hall, having published three thousand copies at Liverpool: he presented a copy to the Library of the British Museum. The copyright was secured in forty-eight hours after the last sheets were obtained from the printers; which defeated a secret plan of some of our enemies who were taking measures to print the book and secure the copyright.</p>
<p><em>Sunday, 8.</em>--At four p.m., I met with the Twelve and others for counsel and prayer: we decided that Elder Orson Hyde go to the east and buy canvas for a Tabernacle [tent], and type to print the History of Joseph Smith. General Conference of Seventies met and proceeded with the organization of the quorums.</p>
<p>A conference was held in Florence, St. Joseph county, Michigan, when one hundred and twenty-eight members, one high priest, sixteen elders and four of the lesser priesthood were represented; Elder Crandall Dunn, president and Elder E. M. Webb, clerk.</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 10.</em>--I met in council with the brethren of the Twelve, and discussed the title of the Church History.</p>
<p><a name="427" id="427"></a>[Page 427]</p>
<p><em>Thursday, 12.</em>--I spent the afternoon with several of the Twelve.</p>
<p><em>Sunday, 15.</em>--Elder Orson Hyde preached at the stand; Elder George A. Smith advocated the building of the Nauvoo House, and was followed by Elders Amasa M. Lyman and George Miller on the same subject. The high priests' quorum met. Evening, I met with the Twelve. The seventies met; Elder Joseph Young and others preached.</p>
<p><em>Monday, 16.</em>--Council met on the Temple walls.</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 17.</em>--The Council of the Twelve wrote the following:</p>
<p>Letter of the Twelve to the Saints Abroad</p>
<p><em>'To the Saints Abroad, Greeting:</em></p>
<p>The walls of our Temple are completed and the roof is nearly on. Through the liberality of the brethren that building is in a rapid state of advancement; but it will only accommodate a small portion of our congregation when completed.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the counsel of Joseph Smith given previous to his martyrdom, we now intend to erect a Tabernacle for the congregation made of canvas. It will take about four thousand yards, which, with other fixtures, will cost between one and two thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>Elder Hyde's Mission to Secure a Tent Tabernacle.</strong></p>
<p>We have appointed Elder Orson Hyde one of our own quorum, a faithful, trusty and competent man of God, to go forth and raise all the necessary funds for the above purpose, to procure the materials and return with them to this place as soon as possible. Elder Hyde is authorized to raise the necessary funds by loan, by contribution or tithing or donation if by loan; the church here will refund the same in lands at a low rate, or in cash as soon as we can command it; and any contract that he may make in relation to the above, the church will be responsible for.</p>
<p>It is hoped that no brother or sister who has funds that he or she can spare for a season will withhold them from Brother Hyde, for it is the aid that he seeks for us. Also we hope that the saints will be liberal in their donations, and every other person that wishes well to the Temple of God and to the Tabernacle of the congregation in Zion. May God bless all that feel interested in the matter.'</p>
<p>Bishop Whitney started for St. Louis with $1,549 to purchase materials for the Temple.</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 18.</em>--I met with Elders Heber C. Kimball, John Taylor and George A. Smith at Brother Taylor's; we revised a portion of the History of Joseph Smith.</p>
<p><a name="428" id="428"></a>[Page 428]</p>
<p>Elders Phineas H. Young and Charles Shumway returned from their missions and reported favorably.</p>
<p><em>Thursday, 19.</em>--I spent the day with Brothers H. C. Kimball and George A. Smith revising history. Evening, the Twelve met for council and prayer.</p>
<p>I received a lengthy letter from Mr. H. R. Hotchkiss in relation to the necessity of establishing manufactories in Nauvoo for the employment of our rapidly increasing population of mechanics.</p>
<p><em>Friday, 20.</em>--Elders H. C. Kimball, Orson Pratt, George A. Smith, and myself engaged revising Church History.</p>
<p><em>Sunday, 22.</em>--Meeting at the stand; Elder Orson Pratt preached, but as it rained heavily, the meeting was dismissed. Evening, I met with the Twelve and others for prayer; Sister Jennetta Richards being very sick was administered to.</p>
<p><strong>Arrest of Orrin Porter Rockwell. Other Attempted Arrests</strong></p>
<p><em>Monday, 23.</em>--The sheriff came in with writs for a number of brethren and succeeded in arresting O. P. Rockwell and J. P. Harmon, but Rockwell got away from him. A constable from Le Harpe came in with writs for Brother Taylor, myself and others, but we kept out of the way.</p>
<p>Jonathan Dunham who was on a mission to the Lamanites received a notification from Ranes, the Indian Agent of the Neosha sub-agency to leave the country immediately.</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, 24.</em>--I examined Church History with the brethren. Evening, Hiram Kimball and D. H. Wells returned from Carthage and brought word that Sheriff Deming had shot Sam Marshall.</p>
<p><strong>William Smith <em>vs.</em> Nauvoo Police.</strong></p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 25.</em>--At three p.m., I met with the Quorum of the Twelve for prayer; and in council in relation to a difficulty between William Smith and Brother Elbridge Tufts.</p>
<p>After council the Twelve met with the police at the Masonic Hall when Wm. Smith delivered a very pathetic speech, delineating in a sectarian tone, the wrongs that his brothers and himself had sustained; asserting that we were all dependent upon his family for the priesthood, and pronouncing the most fearful anathemas upon all those who should not sustain him in his course, justifying his assault upon Brother Tufts, and demanding of the Twelve to inform the police that it was their duty to take his counsel in relation to the manner they discharge their duty. I told him that as an officer Brother Tuft was subject to the magistrates, and had no right to discharge a prisoner only by the order of the proper officer; that he (Brother William Smith) had no more right to interfere with the police than I had; that when he beat Brother Tufts for refusing to discharge his prisoner, he was doing wrong, and meddling with that which was not his business and should make satisfaction; that we received the priesthood from God through Joseph Smith and not through William, and that he had no authority or power to curse the Twelve Apostles who received the priesthood from Joseph; that we were not influenced by his curses, and that his prayers and imprecations upon the heads of those who were seeking to fulfill the instructions of Joseph to the letter would rise no higher than the smoke from a dung hill.</p>
<p><a name="429" id="429"></a>[Page 429]</p>
<p>Brother William appeared humbled and agreed to make ample satisfaction to Brother Tufts.</p>
<p><strong>James Arlington Bennett.</strong></p>
<p>Received a letter from James Arlington Bennett of New York, in which he applies to be consecrated a general of the Nauvoo Legion, that he may 'fight Napoleon's battles over again, either in Nauvoo or elsewhere.' This wild spirit of ambition has repeatedly manifested itself to us by many communications received from various sources, suggesting schemes of blood and empire, as if the work of the Lord was intended for personal aggrandizement.</p>
<p><em>Thursday, 26.</em>--The Twelve met for council and prayer: several children were blessed. The first stone for the new font was laid in the Temple.</p>
<p><a name="430" id="430"></a>[Page 430]</p>
<p><em>Friday, 27.</em>--Elders Heber C. Kimball, Orson Pratt, Amasa M. Lyman, George A. Smith, Willard Richards, John E. Page, George Miller, Joseph Young and John Taylor met for fasting, prayer and counsel.</p>
<p>I wrote the following letter to Elder Woodruff:</p>
<p>Brigham Young's Letter to Wilford Woodruff in England--Progress and Unity in Nauvoo</p>
<p>'Nauvoo, June 27th, 1845.</p>
<p><em>Dear Brother Woodruff.</em>--We sit down to acknowledge the receipt of your letters, and it being one year this day since the massacre of our beloved brethren Joseph and Hyrum, we have concluded to spend the day in conversation, counsel and prayer, and also to write answers to your letters, well knowing that a little information from this place must be acceptable to you at all times, for we feel it as a source of comfort to us to hear of your prosperity. We have met from time to time to offer up our prayers and thanksgivings before the Lord for the salvation and peace of the saints, and that the Lord would enable us to finish the Temple and the Nauvoo House that the brethren might obtain their endowments, for this we have supplicated by night and by day, and hitherto we have been prospered in a manner beyond our most sanguine expectations. Another subject for which we have constantly supplicated is the welfare and success of our dear brethren in England, Brother Parley P. Pratt in New York, and the brethren on the Islands of the Pacific, these with our petitions for the sick in our midst, and that God will preserve us from internal broils, has been the theme of our prayers from time to time, and we are happy to say that God has heard and answered our prayers, and has done all things well. The most perfect union, peace and good feeling has invariably prevailed in our midst and still continues. It seems like a foretaste of celestial enjoyment and Millennial glory.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The capstone of the Temple was laid by the Twelve on Saturday morning the 24th of May, at six o'clock, in the presence of many saints. It would have pleased you to have heard the hosannas on that occasion, and to have witnessed the short but interesting ceremony. The frame work of the roof is on the building, and the next week the brethren expect to put on the shingles; the frame work around the foundation of the tower is all up, and the first timbers for the tower itself were raised this day. The new stone front is mostly cut, and the first stone was laid today at about four o'clock. We expect in about five or six weeks the attic story of the Temple and the font will be all finished and ready for dedication, and just as soon as they are ready we shall dedicate them. We have all the timbers for the Temple on the ground, and above one hundred thousand shingles for the roof. The lead for the eaves and the tin for the dome of the tower are also bought. We have paid near 4000 dollars this spring for lumber (pine, boards, etc.) and near 1000 dollars for lead and tin, and have as yet lacked nothing. There is the most perfect union prevailing among the saints, and every man seems determined to do all he can to roll on the work of the Temple as fast as possible. Elder Hyde started east, about ten days ago, to purchase the cloth for the Tabernacle; and Elder Egan is gone to St. Louis to buy about 125 dollars worth of hemp to make cords for it.</p>
<p><a name="431" id="431"></a>[Page 431]</p>
<p>The brethren are clearing the ground round the Temple, and we expect to have the Tabernacle reared, so as to be ready to meet in this fall.</p>
<p>We are building a stone wall around the Temple block, eight feet high and about five feet thick at the base, the wall on the north side is nearly built, the most of the woodwork for the Temple is finished, all the window frames and sashes are made, and the glaziers are ready to set the glass, which we expect here in a few days, the frame and ornamental work of the tower is all ready to be put up, and the whole is far on the way of completion. The Nauvoo House Committee have reorganized, and the saints have appointed Elders A. Lyman and George A. Smith on that committee, in the place of Lyman Wight and J. Snider. A large quantity of brick is already made for the Nauvoo House, and considerable means are on hand to prosecute the work. We calculate to have it covered in before winter. The arsenal is ready for the roof timbers and the timbers on the ground. There are many good buildings erecting in different parts of the city, there is not much sickness in the place, and there never was a more prosperous time, in general, amongst the saints, since the work commenced. Nauvoo, or, more properly, the 'City of Joseph', looks like a paradise. All the lots and land, which have heretofore been vacant and unoccupied, were enclosed in the spring, and planted with grain and vegetables, which makes it look more like a garden of gardens than a city; and the season has been so favorable, the prospect is, there will be enough raised within the limits of the corporation to supply the inhabitants with corn, potatoes, and other vegetables. Hundreds of acres of prairie land have also been enclosed, and are now under good cultivation, blooming with corn, wheat, potatoes, and other necessaries of life. Many strangers are pouring in to view the Temple and the city. They express their astonishment and surprise to see the rapid progress of the Temple, and the beauty and grandeur of Mormon looks. Many brethren are coming from abroad, who seem highly delighted with the place and all its appendages.</p>
<p>We now conclude with our best wishes and prayers for your health and prosperity with that of your family, and those associated with you. Please remember us to Brothers Clark, Hedlock and families, and those of all the brethren with you, and believe us to be as ever--yours in the bonds of truth and righteousness.</p>

<p>P.S. <em>Sunday, June 29.</em>--This day the twenty-eighth quorum of the seventies has been organized, and is nearly full. There are twenty-seven quorums duly organized and all appear united in the same interest, and firm in the faith. Brother Milton Holmes is remembered by us in his station, he has been appointed one of the presidents of a quorum of seventies.' <a class="footnote" href="#fn-3">3</a></p>
<p>The saints in England observed this, the anniversary of the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum, by fasting and prayer: Elder Woodruff addressed a large assembly of saints at Birmingham.</p>
<p><em>Saturday, 28.</em>--A number of brethren met and removed the stand and benches to the ground west of the Temple.</p>
<p>I rode out to the prairie with several of the Twelve: we felt thankful to God to see the crops looking so well.</p>
<p><strong>Bonds for General Deming--a Contrast.</strong></p>
<p>Some of our wealthy brethren went to Carthage and became sureties on the bond upon which General Deming was set at liberty: the sum required was ten thousand dollars. Each signer was required to swear to the lowest cash value of his property and that it did not lie in the City of Nauvoo and he was then taken for one-half the sworn amount, so that twenty thousand dollars in property at its lowest cash value was held in security for General Deming's appearance at court. This contrasts strangely with the clemency extended by the court to Sharp, Williams, Aldrich, Grover, and Davis who were admitted to bail at the last court for one thousand dollars each on their own security; Deming having killed Marshall in self-defense, while the others violated the solemn faith of the state, pledged by its executive, and murdered innocent, unoffending men while confined in helpless condition in a prison awaiting examination!</p>
<p>Thirteen hundred dwellings were burned in Quebec, Canada, and at least six thousand persons were rendered homeless.</p>

<p><strong>Attempted Reconcilliation with William Smith and the Twelve.</strong></p>
<p>Father John Smith and Brother George A. Smith called upon William Smith in relation to his mother's visions. William evinced a very bitter spirit and declared himself President of the Church, and said that he would have his rights: his uncle reasoned with him and endeavored to show him the falsity of his position.</p>
<p><em>Sunday, 29.</em>--Elder Ezra T. Benson and I preached in the forenoon and Elders John Taylor and Amasa M. Lyman in the afternoon, at the grove west of the Temple. Evening, I met with the Twelve and others for prayer.</p>
<p><em>Monday, 30.</em>--Visited Mother Smith in company with the Twelve and Bishops Whitney and Miller. William Smith was invited but did not attend. Mother Smith expressed herself satisfied with the Twelve and the course they were pursuing.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p><em>Tuesday, July 8, 1845.</em>--Brother Joseph Toronto handed to me $2,500 in gold and said he wanted to give himself and all he had to the upbuilding of the church and kingdom of God; he said he should henceforth look to me for protection and counsel. I laid the money at the feet of the bishops.</p>
<p><em>Wednesday, 9.</em>--Sister Jennetta Richards, wife of Dr. Willard Richards, died at 10:15 a.m.</p>

<p><strong>Kindness to Mother Lucy Smith.</strong></p>

We selected block 96 and 97 and then went to Mother Smith's and brought her in the carriage to choose which of the two blocks she would have deeded to herself and her daughters. She selected block 96, and desired to have the church build her a house like Brother Kimball's. She asked for the carriage we rode in, a horse and a double carriage harness. We gave her the use of the carriage during her lifetime.</p>

<p>Temple At Nauvoo</p>
<p>'The building of the Mormon Temple under all the troubles by which those people have been surrounded, seems to be carried on with a religious enthusiasm which reminds us of olden times, by the energy which controls all the movements towards its completion. It occupies the highest and most imposing position in Nauvoo and is built of fine limestone. Has thirty pilasters--six at each end and nine at each side--each surmounted by a capital on which is carved a human face with rays around it and two hands holding trumpets. The Temple is 88 feet by 128 feet; from floor to ceiling is 65 feet; and from the ground to the top of the spire is 165 feet. The baptismal font is in the basement, to be supported by stone oxen. Three hundred and fifty men are zealously at work upon the building, which it is supposed will be finished in a year and a half, probably at a cost of half a million of dollars. The spiritual concerns of the Mormons are governed by a Council of Twelve, composed of the following persons</p>
<p>Brigham Young--<em>The Lion of the Lord.</em></p>
<p>H. C. Kimball--<em>The Herald of Grace,</em></p>
<p>Parley P. Pratt--<em>The Archer of Paradise.</em></p>
<p>Orson Hyde--<em>The Olive Branch of Israel.</em></p>
<p>Willard Richards--<em>The Keeper of the Rolls.</em></p>
<p>John Taylor--<em>The Champion of Right.</em></p>
<p>Wm. Smith--<em>The Patriarchal, Jacob's Staff.</em></p>
<p>Wilford Woodruff--<em>The Banner of the Gospel.</em></p>
<p>George A. Smith--<em>The Entablature of Truth.</em></p>
<p>Orson Pratt--<em>The Gauge of Philosophy.</em></p>
<p>John E. Page--<em>The Sundial.</em></p>
<p>Lyman Wight--<em>The Wild Ram of the Mountains.</em></p>
<p>It is supposed that the Mormon inhabitants of this city are fully 12,000 souls, and of the surrounding country, 5,000 more. The only property owned in common is the Temple. The Mormons are industrious, good farmers, raise wheat plentifully, and are about to engage in manufactures. The whole community may be considered in their peculiar traits singular and remarkable and in after ages their Temple, like the ruins of Palenque may strike the beholder with wonder and history may be unable to explain what race worshiped there.' <a href="https://byustudies-dev.byu.edu/hc/7/32.html#fn-4">4</a></p>

<p><a name="fn-1" id="fn-1"></a>1. John Hay, secretary of state in two presidential administrations--McKinley's and Roosevelt's, 1898-1905--who as a boy was reared in Hancock county, in the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> for December, 1869, contributed an article on the "Mormon Prophet's Tragedy", in which he reviews this mass trial of the above named characters, where at one point he writes: "The case was closed, there was not a man on the jury, in the court, in the county, that did not know the defendants had done murder. But it was not proven, and the verdict of 'not guilty' was right in law." Rather a sad comment on justice in Illinois at that time (See <em>Comprehensive History of the Church,</em> Century I, vol. 2, p. 327).</p>
