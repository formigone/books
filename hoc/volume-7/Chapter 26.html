<p><em>"Monday, December 30, 1844.</em>--The following is extracted from the <em>Times and Seasons,</em> Vol. 6, p. 794:--</p>
<p>Dedication of the Seventies' Hall</p>
<p>(<em>Five Days, Dec. 26-30, 1844. (A Memorable Conference)</em></p>
<p><em>'Thursday, December 26, A. D. 1844.</em>--The services commenced under the direction of President Joseph Young [the Senior President of the First Quorum of the Seventy], who organized the meeting in the following order:</p>
<p><strong>Arrangement of the Meeting.</strong></p>
<p>The stand was occupied by the Seven Presiding Presidents of the Seventy, and the Twelve or as many of them as were present. The senior president of each quorum was seated on the right, the choir of singers on the left, and the brass band in front. The second and third quorums in order, with their families, occupied and other seats for the day. Each day afforded a new congregation, that all the seventies, with their families, might in turn, participate in the privilege of the dedication, according to their respective quorums, there being fifteen quorums whose claims were equal, two of which convened in the hall each day, beginning with the second and third [quorums].</p>
<p><a name="331" id="331"></a>[Page 331]</p>
<p>The excellent melody of the choir and band, mingling with the devout aspirations of a congregation of all saints, gave the commencement of their services an air of interest, felicity and glory, at once feeling, touching, pathetic, grand, sublime!</p>
<p>A hymn, composed by Elder W. W. Phelps, for the dedication, entitled 'A Voice from the Prophet: Come to Me', was sung:</p>
<p>A Voice from the Prophet<br />
'Come to Me'</p>
<p><em>(By W. W. Phelps, to the Tune--'Indian Hunter')</em></p>
<p>'Come to me, will ye come to the saints that have died--<br />
To the next better world, where the righteous reside;<br />
Where the angels and spirits in harmony be.<br />
In the joys of a vast Paradise? Come to me.<br />
Come to me where the truth and the virtues prevail;<br />
Where the union is one, and the years never fail;<br />
Where the heart can't conceive, nor the natural eye see,<br />
What the Lord has prepar'd for the just: Come to me.<br />
Come to me where there is no destruction or war;<br />
Neither tyrants, nor mobbers, or nations ajar;<br />
Where the system is perfect, and happiness free,<br />
And the life is eternal with God: Come to me.<br />
Come to me, will ye come to the mansions above<br />
Where the bliss and the knowledge, the light, and the love,<br />
And the glory of God, do eternally be?<br />
Death, the wages of sin, is not here: Come to me.<br />
Come to me, here are Adam and Eve at the head<br />
Of a multitude quicken'd and rais'd from the dead:<br />
Here's the knowledge that was, or that is, or will be--<br />
In the gen'ral assembly of worlds: Come to me.<br />
Come to me; here's the myst'ry that man hath not seen;<br />
Here's our Father in heaven, and Mother, the Queen,<br />
Here are worlds that have been, and the worlds yet to be,<br />
Here's eternity,--endless; amen: Come to me.<br />
Come to me all ye faithful and blest of Nauvoo:<br />
Come ye Twelve, and ye High Priests, and Seventies, too;<br />
Come ye Elders, and all of the great company;--<br />
When you've finish'd your work on the earth: Come to me,<br />
Come to me; here's the future, the present and past:<br />
Here is Alpha, Omega, the first and the last;<br />
Here's the fountain, the 'river of life', and the Tree;<br />
Here's your Prophet and Seer, Joseph Smith: Come to me.'</p>

<p>The dedication prayer by President Brigham Young, was in substance as follows:</p>
<p>Prayer: A Supplication to the Throne of Grace</p>
<p>'Thou God who dwellest in the midst of thine own kingdoms, and doeth thy pleasure in the midst of the same. We realize that we are thy children, although we have long wandered from thee. Yet we feel that it is thy good pleasure to bless us, when we come unto thee with hearts of humility. Therefore we desire to present ourselves before thee as dutiful children to an earthly parent, knowing that we are thine and ask thee for those things we need. We feel, our Father, that we are in a world of darkness, and trouble, and death, where we cannot behold thy glory; yet we come unto thee in the name of Jesus Christ, thy Son, and ask thee to forgive our sins and past offenses. Fill us with thy Spirit, and accept our praise, while we dedicate ourselves unto thee, and as we have approximated to behold this beautiful morning, the day in which begins a new year, do thou, our heavenly Father, look down in compassion upon us, the creatures of thy care and protection, who dwell upon thy footstool. Increase our knowledge, wisdom, and understanding, that we, thy servants, may be enabled to administer salvation to thy people, even as thou hast committed a dispensation of the same unto us; and while we call on thy name we desire union in thy presence, our Father, to dedicate unto thee this hall, the ground upon which it stands, and all things that appertain unto it. We ask thee to let thy blessing rest upon thy servant Edward Hunter, our beloved brother, who has donated to us the ground upon which this sacred edifice has been erected. We pray thee to enrich him and his family, not only with the good things of this world, but with the riches of eternity also. We ask thee, our Father, to accept the dedication of our hearts this morning, and may we feel the prelude of that power and authority with which thy servants shall be clothed, when they shall go forth and open the door of salvation to the nations and kingdoms of the earth; even thy servants, the seventies, upon whom the burden of thy kingdom does rest, and to whom the keys of the same shall be committed from time to time. We now dedicate this hall unto thee, our Father, and ask thee in the name of thy Son Jesus Christ, to sanctify it and make it holy, and may no foul spirit be suffered to enter it, but may it be filled with thy Spirit, that it may be called the gate of heaven, and may all who enter within its doors be made to feel thy love and power. We ask thee to pour out thy Spirit upon the Presidency of the Seventies; wilt thou endow them with knowledge and understanding that they may be enabled to instruct thy servants over whom they are called to preside; and do thou let the same blessings flow freely upon each quorum, that all thy servants may be filled with thy Spirit. and become mighty men before thee that they may go forth and gather the pure in heart, Zion redeemed and Jerusalem rebuilt. Help us O Lord to separate ourselves from all iniquity, that evildoers may not exist in our midst, but may this people become a holy people, peculiar to thyself, to show forth thy praise in all the world. Our Father in heaven, we humbly beseech thee to shield and protect us in this city; provide for and sustain us by thy power, that we may be enabled to accomplish the work which thou hast commanded us to do. Assist us to build the Temple and Nauvoo House; that the truth and light of the everlasting gospel may shine forth from this place, to the honor, praise and glory of thy name. Regard in mercy the Quorum of the Twelve, at whom the arrows of the destroyer are directed. Preserve them O Lord, by thine own omnipotent power, that they may stand in holy places and be enabled to disseminate the knowledge of thy kingdom to the inhabitants of the earth; wilt thou sustain us, our Father, that we may perform and accomplish the mighty work whereunto we are called.</p>
<p><a name="333" id="333"></a>[Page 333]</p>
<p>'We feel to lament and mourn the loss of our beloved brothers, Joseph and Hyrum, the Prophet and Patriarch, whom thou hast suffered to be martyred for the testimony of the truth; but we thank thee our Father, that although they have been taken from us for the present, yet that same spirit which animated their bosoms, the fruits of which is peace and charity, still remains amongst thy people. We now commit ourselves into thy care, and ask thee to guide and control us by the council of heaven, through all the shifting and various scenes of mortality, that the numbers of our days may be filled up in usefulness, and we be prepared for that exalted station and rest that remains for the people of God, and the honor, praise, and glory of our salvation, we will ascribe unto thee; for thine is the kingdom, power and glory, worlds without end: Amen.' <a class="footnote" href="#fn-1">1</a></p>
<p>A hymn composed by Elder John Taylor for the dedication of the Seventies' Hall and dedicated to President Brigham Young, was sung by Elder John Kay, assisted by the band, entitled 'The Seer'.</p>
<p>The Seer</p>
<p>'The Seer;--the Seer;--Joseph the Seer--<br />
I'll sing of the Prophet ever dear,<br />
His equal now cannot be found,--<br />
By searching the wide world around.<br />
With Gods he soared in the realms of day;<br />
And men he taught the heavenly way.<br />
'Mid the foaming billows of angry strife--<br />
He stood at the helm of the ship of life.<br />
The earthly Seer; the heavenly Seer,<br />
I love to dwell on his mem'ry dear;--<br />
The chosen of God, and the friend of men,<br />
He brought the priesthood back again,<br />
He gazed on the past, on the present too;--<br />
And ope'd the heavenly world to view.<br />
Of noble seed--of heavenly birth,<br />
He came to bless the sons of earth;<br />
With keys by the Almighty given,<br />
He opened the full rich stores of heaven,<br />
O'er the world that was wrapt in sable night<br />
Like the sun he spread his golden light.<br />
He strove,--O, how he strove to stay,<br />
The stream of crime in its reckless way--<br />
He urged the wayward to reclaim;<br />
With a mighty mind, and a noble aim.<br />
The saints;--the saints; his only pride,<br />
For them he lived, for them he died!<br />
Their joys were his;--their sorrows too;--<br />
He lov'd the saints;--he lov'd Nauvoo.<br />
Unchanged in death, with a Savior's love<br />
He pleads their cause, in the courts above,<br />
The Seer;--the Seer--Joseph the Seer!<br />
O, how I love his memory dear,<br />
The just and wise, the pure and free,<br />
A father he was, and is to me.<br />
Let fiends now rage in their dark hour;<br />
No matter, he is beyond their power.<br />
He's free;--he's free;--the Prophet's free!<br />
He is where he will ever be.<br />
Beyond the reach of mobs and strife,<br />
He rests unharm'd in endless life.<br />
His home's in the sky;--he dwells with the Gods<br />
Far from the furious rage of mobs.<br />
He died; he died--for those he lov'd<br />
He reigns;--he reigns in the realms above,<br />
He waits with the just who have gone before,<br />
To welcome the saints to Zion's shore;<br />
Shout, shout ye saints--this boon is given,<br />
We'll meet our martyr'd Seer in heaven.' <a class="footnote" href="#fn-2">2</a></p>

<p>Remarks of Elder Heber C. Kimball</p>
<p>Elder Heber C. Kimball addressed the congregation in plain though impressive language, and in his usual philanthropic manner, used a chain as a figure to illustrate the principle of gradation, while in pursuit of celestial enjoyment in worlds to come.</p>
<p>Elder George A. Smith's Discourse and Admonition on Union</p>
<p>Elder George A. Smith offered some very appropriate remarks relative to union. He referred to the Zion Camp, and their expedition to Missouri, and after giving an interesting account on that subject, concluded with an exhortation to union, firmness, and perseverance. He said that if we were of one heart and mind, we might be as the angels are. Perfect union and harmony exist among them. Hence their concert of action, and consequently their influence and power with God; and upon the same principle [continued he] we could make a heaven wherever in the dispensation of Providence, we might be placed, possessing this principle, consonant with the honors, glory and immortality of angels.</p>
<p>At 12 o'clock, a recess of one hour was given each day. At 1 o'clock the house was called to order by President Joseph Young.</p>
<p><a name="335" id="335"></a>[Page 335]</p>
<p>Discourse of Elder Orson Hyde on Union--An Illustration</p>
<p>Illustration of the Force in Unity.</p>
<p>Elder Orson Hyde took the stand, and continued the same subject, [unity of spirit and action], and introduced for a comparison the circumstance of the Assyrian king, who gave his son a bundle of arrows bound in a quiver, and commanded him to break them, which he in vain attempted to do while they were firmly bound together; but when they were unbound and separated, the object was easily effected. This circumstance he likened to this people, and said that if we were united we would be able to stand against all the fiery darts that could be hurled upon us by the adversary of our salvation. Some having a knowledge of this fact, have used every effort to divide this people, in order to accomplish their wicked designs. Some few have been led to the north, others to the west, and some to the east. Those who have separated may be broken; but those who remain together firmly united can never be broken.</p>
<p><a name="336" id="336"></a>[Page 336]</p>
<p><strong>Apostles Witnesses for God.</strong></p>
<p>After speaking of authorities in the church or kingdom of God, he observed that 'Apostles in the primitive age of Christianity were first made witnesses to all the nations of the earth. They were afterwards made judges of that same people. Hence the saying of the Apostles, 'know ye not that the saints shall judge the world?' that is, that generation or people to whom they were sent as witnesses. (See <a class="scriplink" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/6.2-3?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">1 Cor. 6:2-3.</a>) Indeed they were competent to sit in judgment upon them, having had an experimental knowledge of their course of conduct and barbarous treatment towards the servants of God that were sent to establish peace among them. Many of whom they did not only reject, but tortured and slew them in a cruel manner. This was the fate of the Prophets and Apostles who vainly attempted to restore them from their wickedness, assuring them, to use the language of the scripture: 'As you mete out to others, so shall it be measured to you again.'</p>
<p><strong>Measure to Babylon Double.</strong></p>
<p>'The declaration of John while on the Isle of Patmos, through the Spirit of God, declaring things which would come to pass, says: Give her double for all her sins. The reason is obvious. The debt was of a long standing; she had exercised unceasing tyranny over the servants of God, and refused them justice and mercy. Therefore as they meted out, double measure shall be given them in return. I have no doubt,' said he, 'but the old scribes, and pharisees, after scourging the saints in the most horrid manner, and causing many to seal their testimony with their blood, would go into the Temple with all the sanctity imaginable and ask God to forgive their sins; when in reality he would have nothing to do with the matter, until they had first obtained forgiveness from those whom they had injured, by making ample satisfaction to them. For proof of this fact just examine the declaration of Jesus to the Apostles: Whose soever sins ye remit on earth, shall be remitted in heaven. And if they were retained on earth they were to be retained in heaven also.</p>
<p><a name="337" id="337"></a>[Page 337]</p>
<p>'Neither can this generation get forgiveness from God, for the great injuries that they have done us as a people, without first rendering perfect satisfaction to us whom they have injured. The elders of this church have been swift witnesses to Missouri, and all the world. Hence in vain may they plead to have their sins remitted until the proper steps are taken.</p>
<p><strong>Burden of the Kingdom Has Fallen Upon the Twelve.</strong></p>
<p>'Our Prophet has been slain, and the burden of the kingdom has fallen upon us (the Twelve) and our lives are sought after; but while the angel that administers to man is still in attendance, his life is protected, for the guardian is stronger than death; but when he is withdrawn humanity is easily overcome. Hence it was with the Son of God while upon the cross, that even he, the Savior of the world, could but exclaim: My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me! Referring to the protecting angel whom the Lord had called away, leaving Jesus in the arms of death; that he might be taken away from this world of misery and pain to the mansions of God, where he should turn and rule the nations with a rod of iron [i. e. the law, or word of God]. For proof of my assertion I have only to call upon the same individual who exclaimed on the cross: My God why hast thou taken away my protecting angel.</p>
<p><a name="338" id="338"></a>[Page 338]</p>
<p>'At the time of his arrest he commanded Peter to put up his sword and gave him to understand that if it were the will of God that he should not drink of the bitter cup (death) that he could call on his Father for ten legions of angels who would eagerly fly to his deliverance. But had he been delivered from the cross, how could the scriptures have been fulfilled? * * *</p>
<p><strong>Efforts to Break up the Unity of the Saints.</strong></p>
<p>'Another word respecting the arrows, which by the Spirit of God was made manifest to me last summer. There were certain persons who endeavored to divide and draw away the saints from this place, by telling them in secret councils: I have the wink from the Twelve; their minds are to sanction our going to build up, etc. I have got my work laid out by revelation; but you must not say a word to them (the Twelve) about this matter, for if you do you will not get any satisfaction, they will disclaim in public any knowledge of such a move; but I understand them; all is right; and thus hold them in ignorance; also, bind them by solemn oath, not to disclose the matter to any human being, not even to their wives, under the penalty of death. Through hypocrisy and false statements, a few, and but a few, have been deceived and torn from the bundle of arrows by those who have led off from this place. This is an aspiring spirit and is from the devil, and every spirit that refuses to make manifest, is from Lucifer, the prince of darkness. Now let the saints, from this time forth be guarded against all such secrets, councils or confirmations.'</p>
<p>Elder Amasa M. Lyman's Discourse</p>
<p>Effects of This Notable Meeting of Elders.</p>
<p>Elder Amasa M. Lyman expressed his gratitude to God for the favorable circumstances under which we were placed at present. Said he, when we contemplate the exalted station and high calling of this august body of elders, we can but associate it with their future destiny. They, as a people are only forming a character for heaven and immortal happiness. This certainly should stimulate each man of you to action, and remove every drowsy, careless, idle feeling from their minds, while in each heart the most lively sensations of joy should spring up. He advised them to embrace every opportunity afforded them to improve their minds and obtain useful knowledge. Just take the saints out of the world, said he, and soon destruction would sweep the land, as was the fact with Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>
<p><a name="339" id="339"></a>[Page 339]</p>
<p><strong>The Seventies' Library and Institute.</strong></p>
<p>In speaking of the Seventies' Library and Institute Association, he remarked that the seventies were designed to be messengers to every land and kingdom under heaven, and consequently they will have ample opportunities to gather many antiquities, with various books, charts, etc., to deposit in the library for the advancement of art and science, which, with just principles, will go heart and hand unto perfection, being built upon truth, the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ the Chief Corner Stone, which shall sound out from this voluminous institute, and with its benign influence organize and harmonize the vast extent of the world.</p>
<p><em>Friday, December 27.</em>----Fourth and fifth quorums met. Prayer by Elder George A. Smith.</p>
<p>The order of the meeting was explained by President Joseph Young.</p>
<p>Heber C. Kimball's Address</p>
<p>Joseph Smith's Place in the Resurrection.</p>
<p>Elder Heber C. Kimball then delivered a short address upon the authorities of the kingdom of God, and in passing on, he set forth the order as to endowment, and informed the saints that every man and woman must stand in his proper place and station, being subject to the powers that be, in order to be exalted to glory, honor, and immortality in the eternal world. 'It is even so in the resurrection from the dead, as St. Paul informs us that Christ is the first fruits of the resurrection from the dead in the primitive age, and so will Joseph Smith be in this dispensation. Joseph will be the first man who will rise from the dead, and then all men according to their proper order.</p>
<p><a name="340" id="340"></a>[Page 340]</p>
<p><strong>Submit to the Powers That Be.</strong></p>
<p>'I will tell the seventies and everybody else, if you cannot and will not submit to the authorities that God has placed in his church over you, you had better back out now, and not attempt to proceed further; if you are ever saved it will be by obedience to the order of God's kingdom here on the earth, and this order is in subordination to that order which is in the heavens. According to the important station the seventies are called to fill in this last dispensation, they should be careful to walk uprightly and act justly, shunning every appearance of evil and never condescend to do anything mean.'</p>
<p>Adjourned one hour.</p>
<p>Met pursuant to adjournment.</p>
<p>Elder John Taylor's Discourse--Relationship of the Church to God</p>
<p>Elder John Taylor took the stand and proceeded to lay before us the pure principles of life and salvation, reminding us that we were the people that the Lord had chosen and set apart to accomplish the great and mighty work of the last days, which was spoken of by the prophets of old. 'No other people,' said he, 'can possibly do this work, for unto us the keys of this last dispensation with the power of the priesthood is given; consequently there is no people under the whole heaven that sustain the same relationship with God, as we do. What knowledge have the world of God's laws or his ways? They don't know enough in reality to save a mosquito.</p>
<p><a name="341" id="341"></a>[Page 341]</p>
<p><strong>The Elders of the Church and the Learning of the World.</strong></p>
<p>'I do not mean to say that there is no learning in the world, for I am aware of the fact that there is far more of what the world calls wisdom in the midst of the inhabitants of the earth than can be found here; but a learned fool is no better than an illiterate one, if the Apostle Paul's judgment can be admitted as proof. He told the people of his day that the wisdom of this world was foolishness with God. When I ask what knowledge the world has of God or his government, I mean to be understood as speaking of that knowledge that comes from God, communicated to us through the channel of revelation, for without it we know nothing correctly, no more than the brute beasts who are led by the instinct of nature. Consequently, brethren, when you go to declare the plain truth of the kingdom of God, the gospel of Jesus Christ, you should never shrink from your calling, nor succumb to the learned because of the advantage they have over you by reason of literary attainments, for God is with you, and will give you a mouth and wisdom by which you shall be delivered from the strong arm of violence.</p>
<p><strong>The Race Not to the Swift Nor the Battle to the Strong.</strong></p>
<p>'Remember the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong; but to those who trust in the Lord. When the Twelve were called to bear the gospel of this kingdom to the inhabitants of Europe, there were not many wise among them, speaking after the manner of men; yet we believed him faithful who had chosen us, and as little children we trusted in him for wisdom and understanding to do his will; for his will was our pleasure, and in the short space of two years, about two thousand souls were given to us in the ministry. I speak of these things that you may know in whom to put your trust and confidence; for should you desire self-esteem, and take the honor to yourselves, you soon would sink to shame and disgrace. You are the heralds of salvation, and through your faithfulness, obedience and perseverance, you may be exalted to kings and priests unto God in the eternal worlds.</p>
<p><a name="342" id="342"></a>[Page 342]</p>
<p><strong>Admonitions to the Seventies.</strong></p>
<p>'Some of you may be called to go to foreign lands to administer salvation to nations that are to you unknown. The redemption of your deceased relatives are also required at your hands. Hence you discover your relationship with God and the responsibility under which you are acting. Be faithful in him who has called you, and he will deliver you from every snare, pit, and temptation that awaits you. I would rather trust in God for bread, than to trust in the princes of this world. I speak of these things for your interest; then let your hearts be comforted. When we (the Twelve) left this place, on our mission to England, a journey of near five thousand miles to be accomplished without a penny in our pockets, our only resource was to trust in the Disposer of all events to supply our returning wants. And our prayers were heard and answered according to the desires of our hearts.</p>
<p><strong>Lift Up Your Heads Like Kings.</strong></p>
<p>'When you go forth, lift up your heads like kings and trust in the name of Israel's God; for the very hairs of your head are numbered and will not fall to the ground without notice. Remembering at all times to uphold each other by the prayer and power of faith, and God will bless you and your labors.'</p>
<p>The following prayer was made by President Joseph Young on the fourth day of the dedication.</p>
<p>Prayer of President Joseph Young--Second Prayer of Dedication</p>
<p>'O God, our heavenly Father, we humbly pray thee in the name of Jesus Christ, thy Son, to bless us with the remission of all our sins and vanities; for we are subject to follies and vanities. But we thank thee, our Father, that thou hast prepared a way and provided means whereby we may be enabled to overcome, and elude the grasp of the destroyer. We ask thee, our Father, to guide us by the Spirit, that we may feel thy love shed abroad in our hearts, and fully appreciate every blessing that flows from thy liberal hands. As thou hast seen fit to break the silence of heaven, and again communicated thy will to the sons of men that dwell upon the earth, we ask thee to indict our petitions as we present ourselves in thy presence to dedicate this hall, for we now dedicate it and ourselves unto thee, and ask thee to let a special blessing rest upon him who has bequeathed to us the ground upon which this hall now stands. We remember before thee, our Father, the Building Committee, who were appointed to build the Temple. Let their hands be strengthened to carry on the work and grant that the house may be finished according to thy commandments unto thy people, that thy servants may receive their endowments and be clothed upon with power and authority, to carry thy word to the scattered servants of thy people. Let the Council of the Twelve come in remembrance before thee. Bless them, O Lord, with all that pertains to them. Also the quorums of the seventies, who have built this hall, not particularly by thy commandment, but in honor of thy name. Bless them and their families when they shall go to the islands of the sea, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord, and declare the truth of heaven, the gospel of the Son of God. Let them become mighty men in pulling down the strongholds of satan, and bursting the prison doors of darkness, and spread the light of the everlasting gospel to earth's remotest bounds. Bless the poor who are destitute: open the hearts of the rich, so that the principle of sympathy and charity may predominate and reign in their bosoms, that they may impart of their substance to feed the poor. Finally our Father, we ask thee to guide the destinies of this meeting to thy praise, for thine is the kingdom. power and glory, worlds without end: Amen.'</p>
<p>Remarks of Elder John E. Page, One of the Twelve</p>
<p>Elder John E. Page having arrived here a short time previous with his family from Pittsburgh, being present, was requested to render an account of his stewardship, which he cheerfully assented to.</p>
<p><a name="343" id="343"></a>[Page 343]</p>
<p><strong>The Seventies a Lever in the Hands of God.</strong></p>
<p>He arose and proceeded in a concise manner and gave a very interesting narrative of the events connected with his mission during his absence from this city. He also made many pertinent remarks upon the principles of the kingdom of God, and the organization of the same. He then added that the seventies were in the hands of God as a lever, by which he would turn the world upside down and establish his covenant with the inhabitants of every land; that light and truth should prevail where the powers of darkness, superstition and error had long swayed universal dominion; and finally concluded by assuring the saints that he was one with them, and gave his testimony to the present organization of the church in the most solemn manner, and gave place.</p>
<p><a name="344" id="344"></a>[Page 344]</p>
<p>The Great Discourse of Elder Orson Pratt</p>
<p>Adam Fell That Man Might Be.</p>
<p><em>Monday, December 30.</em>--Elder Orson Pratt took the stand and after many appropriate remarks upon the principle of union, he made a quotation from the <em>Book of Mormon:'</em> Adam fell that man might be--men are that they might have joy', and reasoned upon the correctness of the saying. He said that 'if Adam had not partaken of the fruit of the tree of life, he never could have obeyed the commandment enjoined upon him and the woman, which was to multiply and replenish the earth; (as will appear in the sequel) neither could he have appreciated the blessings of paradise without an experience of the opposite.</p>
<p><strong>Man and Woman in the Fall.</strong></p>
<p>'The Apostle Paul plainly declared that the man was not in the transgression, but the woman; hence we infer that Adam was acquainted of the penalty annexed to the law of God, and with his future destiny, before he partook of the fruit. It might be said that out of two evils the man upon reflection chose the least. The first was the seduction of the woman, by the tempter, which evil would terminate in the banishment of the woman from the garden of paradise, it being one of the penalties annexed to the law for the offense already committed. Adam knowing this fact chose to suffer the penalty of the law with the woman, rather than to be deprived of her society; consequently he followed her into the transgression, as St. Paul remarks. The creature (Adam) was made subject to sin, not willingly; but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope. The hope spoken of here, by Paul, must allude to the redemption of the woman and her posterity from the fall to immortality and eternal life.</p>
<p><a name="345" id="345"></a>[Page 345]</p>
<p>'From this last quotation of the Apostle, we have reason to believe that Adam was encouraged to follow the woman into the transgression, and to people the earth. Whether Adam understood the law of redemption prior to the fall or not, I shall not decide; but shall be contented to submit the circumstance to your consideration.

<p>It was designed at the commencement to have continued each discourse throughout the week; but as that would occupy entirely too much space, will conclude with these brief sketch, already given. Truly this was a time and season of rejoicing with the saints. Peace and harmony, brotherly love, kindness, and charity prevails throughout.</p>
<p>The remembrance of this glorious jubilee will never be erased from the minds of those who were participants. Each family was provided with fruits, nuts and every desert that heart could wish. Well might it be said that the saints enjoyed a feast of fat things.</p>

<p><a name="fn-2" id="fn-2"></a>2. This hymn under the circumstances of its rendition would be very impressive in the congregation of the seventies and their families. John Kay had a rich, deep baritone voice and sang with excellent taste and the martyrdom of the Prophet being as recent, within six months, the saints would be greatly affected by the noble sentiments of Elder Taylor's hymn accompanied with the musical rendition of it.</p>
